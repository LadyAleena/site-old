__DATA__
All of these crossovers are part of the Tommy Westphall Universe. Some crossover enthusiasts have created crossovers where it does not make much sense. Here are those I consider non-crosses, however there may still be crossovers in these non-crosses.
2 Drag a big net
& Dragnet
by NBC and ABC
I<Dragnet> spun off a film of the same name in 1954, I<Dragnet 1967>, I<Dragnet 1966>, I<Dragnet> (1987), I<The New Dragnet>, and I<Dragnet> (2003) which was renamed I<L.A. Dragnet>.
The character Jim Reed from I<Dragnet 1967> Q<The Phony Police Racket> and Q<The Big Search> went on to appear as a regular on I<Adam-12>.

2 The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Gets Smart
& The Man from UNCLE
from ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX
On I<A<The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=U.N.C.L.E.#The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._1964">> Q<The Bow-Wow Affair>, the character Guido Panzini appeared. Guido Panzini would go on to appear on I<McHale's Navy> Q<McHale's Country Club Caper> and I<One Day at a Time> Q<Panzini>.

The last theatrical film I<A<The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=U.N.C.L.E.#The_Return_of_the_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E.">> was new.

The 2008 I<A<Get Smart|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Get+Smart+(2008)">> film and its spin off are not within the same continuity.
2 All in the Families
& All in the Families
from CBS, NBC, ABC, and UPN

Archie and Edith Bunker's daughter, Gloria divorced her husband and received her own series, I<Gloria>. The Bunker's house appeared with new occupants many years later in I<704 Hauser>.
Florida Evans of I<Maude> spun off to her own series, I<Good Times>. The series I<Hanging In> is considered a spin-off of I<Maude>, however its stories are not connected to this cosmology. Also, Barbara Rhoades played Maggie Gallagher on I<Hanging In> and Maggie Chandler on I<Soap>. Because Gallagher &ne; Chandler, there was B<no> crossover. I<Soap> spun off I<Benson>.
Florence Johnston of I<The Jefferson's> briefly had her own series, I<Checking In>. George Jefferson appeared on the pilot of I<E/R>. The Jeffersons appeared on the finale of I<The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air> along with Philip Drummond and Arnold Jackson-Drummond of I<Diff'rent Strokes>.

SMALL<(A<I'm not home!|href="#Im_not_home">)> Arnold Jackson-Drummond made an appearance on I<Silver Spoons> Q<The Great Computer Caper>.
If Greg Morris appeared on I<The Jeffersons> three-part Q<Mission Incredible> as his character Barney Collier from I<Mission: Impossible>, this continuity would cross with Q<A<Lucy's Diagnosis|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Lucys_Diagnosis">>.
2 Hawaii Five-Oh-No!
& Hawaii Five
from CBS
I<A<Hawaii 5-0|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Hawaii+Five-0">> is a remake of I<A<Hawaii 5-O|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Hawaii+Five-O">> and used footage from the original's episode "Wooden Model of a Rat" in the episode "Kalele". While Ed Asner reprised his character August March from the original in the remake, the back story is very different between the series.

3 JAG and NCIS
from CBS, The CW, NBC, and ABC
I<A<JAG|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=JAG">> was on NBC for one season before moving to CBS. It has been severed from Westphall because it used stock footage of A<Oceanic Airlines|href="Big_fake_companies/Oceanic_Airlines#Stock_footage"> from the film I<Executive Decision> not the logo from I<Lost>.
Edward Sheffield from I<JAG> first appeared on I<A<First Monday|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=First+Monday">> in three episodes.
I<JAG> Q<Ice Queen> and Q<Meltdown> were the backdoor pilot for I<A<NCIS|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=NCIS#NCIS">>.

2 The Westerns
& The Westerns
I<Alias Jesse James> and I<The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw> assembled large groups of western television characters.
I<Alias Jesse James> had appearances of Tonto, played by Jay Silverheels, from I<The Lone Ranger> SMALL<(A<Holy defenestration, Batman!|href="Holy_defenestration_Batman">)>; Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper, from I<High Noon>; Annie Oakley, played by Gail Davis, from I<Annie Oakley>; Wyatt Earp, played by Hugh O'Brian, from I<The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp>; Matt Dillon, played by James Arness, from I<Gunsmoke>; Seth Adams, played by Ward Bond, from I<Wagon Train>; and Bret Maverick, played by James Garner, from I<Maverick>.

3 Holy defenestration, Batman!
from ABC, NBC, and CBS
On I<A<Batman|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Batman+(1966)">> many actors have stuck their heads out of a window while Batman and Robin were climbing a wall. In rare cases, a character would stick his head out of a window. These are not crossovers by my definition, though others include them.
When Bill Dana stuck his head out of a window, he appeared as A<himself|href="index.pl#People_not_considered"> not Jose Jimenez from I<The Bill Dana Show>. SMALL<(A<Lucy Makes Room for Daddy|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Lucy_Makes_Room_for_Daddy">)>
I<A<The Addams Family|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=The+Addams+Family+(1964)">> was canceled several months prior to Lurch sticking his head out of a window on I<Batman>.
I<Batman> was set in the 60s, so when Colonel Klink from the World War II era's I<Hogan's Heroes> stuck his head out of a window, he was very out of date. SMALL<(A<Hooterville|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Hooterville">)>
A crossover did not happen when I<A<The Green Hornet|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=The+Green+Hornet+(1966)">> and Kato stuck their heads out of a window in season two of I<Batman>. Near the end of season two, there was a crossover when I<The Green Hornet> and Kato appeared on the I<Batman> episodes Q<A Piece of the Action> and Q<Batman's Satisfaction>. I<The Green Hornet> is a nephew of I<The Lone Ranger> in their respective radio shows. The radio shows were by the same company and then made into television series by the same people, so their crossover works.
2 No News for the Detectives
A A<crossover|href="http://tommywestphall.livejournal.com/25863.html"> between I<Columbo>, I<A<Wonder Woman|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Wonder+Woman+(1975)">>, I<A<Matt Houston|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Matt+Houston">>, I<A<Remington Steele|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Remington+Steele">>, I<A<Moonlighting|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Moonlighting">>, I<City of Angels>, I<Burke's Law> (1994), and I<24> for allegedly using the I<Los Angeles Tribune>, the fictional newspaper from I<Lou Grant>, was attempted. With the amount of networks involved and no discernible connections, I do not see this as a crossover.
3 Mary Tyler Moore
& Mary Tyler Moore
from CBS
I<The Mary Tyler Moore Show> spun off four series: I<Rhoda>, I<Phyllis>, I<Lou Grant>, and I<Mary and Rhoda>. SMALL<(A<I'm not home!|href="Im_not_home">)>
3 Columbo
& Columbo
from NBC and ABC
I<Columbo> spun off the non-contiguous I<Mrs. Columbo>. I<Mrs. Columbo> went through three name changes: I<Kate Columbo>, I<Kate the Detective>, and I<Kate Loves a Mystery>. 
3 Burke's Law
& Burkes Law
from ABC and CBS
I<Burke's Law> (1963) was renamed I<Amos Burke, Secret Agent> in season three. It spun off I<Burke's Law> (1994).
The titular character of I<Honey West> appeared on I<Burke's Law> (1963) Q<Who Killed the Jackpot?> and I<Burke's Law> (1994) Q<Who Killed Nick Hazard?>.
3 Moonlighting
from ABC
Max from I<A<Hart to Hart|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Hart+to+Hart">> appeared on I<A<Moonlighting|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Moonlighting">> Q<It's a Wonderful Job>. In the next I<Moonlighting> episode, Q<The Straight Poop>, Pierce Brosnan from I<Remington Steele> appeared as A<himself|href="index.pl#People_not_considered">.
2 I'm not home!
Many series have been linked because of the series I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!>. I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!> takes the characters out of their original continuities and places them into another. Since they are outside their original continuity, they are not the same characters. So the following do I<not> cross with each other or anything above.
* I<A<Adventures of Superman|href="../Movies_by_series.pl?series=Adventures+of+Superman">>
* I<The Donna Reed Show> or I<Dennis The Menace> though they did cross.
* I<The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis>
* I<Hazel>
* I<The Munsters> and its spin-offs
* I<My Mother the Car>
* I<Get Smart> SMALL<(A<The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Gets Smart|href="#The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._Gets_Smart">)>

* I<Hello, Larry> SMALL<(A<All in the Families|href="#All_in_the_Families">)>
* I<The Cosby Show> and its spin-off I<A Different World>
* All the following, while not contiguous with the above, are contiguous with each other starting with I<A<I Love Lucy|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl">>.
** I<The Dick Van Dyke Show> and I<Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.> SMALL<(A<Lucy Makes Room for Daddy|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Lucy_Makes_Room_for_Daddy">)>
** I<The Honeymooners> and I<The Lucy Show> SMALL<(A<Lucy's Diagnosis|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Lucys_Diagnosis">)>

** I<Mister Ed> and I<The Brady Bunch> SMALL<(A<Hooterville|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Hooterville">)>
2 Two and a Half
I<Two and a Half Men> Q<Fish in a Drawer> did not crossover with I<CSI: Crime Scene Investigation>. I<CSI: Crime Scene Investigation> Q<Two and a Half Deaths> did not crossover with I<Two and a Half Men> because Jon Cryer, Charlie Sheen, and Angus Jones appeared as themselves. SMALL<(A<people not considered|href="index.pl#People_not_considered">)>
I<Two and a Half Men> Q<Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt> crossed over with I<Dharma & Greg> when Dharma and Gregory Montgomery appeared.
2 Legend
& legend
Series with two or more colors were on multiple networks. The main color is the series last network.

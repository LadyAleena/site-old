The crooning|Homeless just blocks away from your temporary residence?!|…I cower|…I crouch|…I crawl
stanza Alone in the grass hills, the wall returning the ball. You|Call out to imaginary players, wishing, "vamoose, vamoose!" as|They randomly drop anchor.

2 Toxin-Laced Letter
stanza Step into the light once|More for the benefit of your own speculation.|Down under the lights on the street fabricate|Your dawn-to-dark, destined to be taken in the mask|Of a growing dependency. Observe much? Shed the|Twilight in the making of times. Memories|To play for, when there are no more clouds to bombard.|I take an Image and make the weight gain more |to wake up the|Connecting temptation.|This slope of a process.|A spiral buried in the sand.|Troublemaker's sight|The gesture and awaken to the fountain of youth,|Fixing their tries. Are you ever inquisitive about what you channel?|The escape of a lost cause, defining the moments in unison, hanging up.|I encountered the same situation tonight under a black dome. Little holes,|Spectacles of light.|I came home a simple man.

2 Eating Raw Bread With A Mammoth
stanza The kitchen floors are covered with my memories.|Like possessions I left behind for friends to endure.|Their reasons unsure to me,|Though perfect legacies for their tough|2 bedrooms.|Oh, those thoughts could burn out|The lamp on those latent, patient fiends.|Springing a concern only to compose a lie.|Animal instinct almost hid the gun.|A models figure saved facts,|To sprout violence on low income.|Vanilla candles wont cure those tattoos.|Only if saving time leads inclination|To thirst for truth.|A seed, symmetrical of walls, dividing planted emotion.|Time lasts the time of losing weight.|Rib cages are puppets for my stomachs stress intake.|Transition needed on my peeling skin.|Wasting another take as I wade my mates in.

+++++ I am Joss Whedon.
++++  I have written so much fan fiction about my favorite couple (bangle, spuffy, cangel, spordy, spangle)
      that they have become part of the family.
+++   I have watched it from the beginning on the WB, know the names of every character, know all the demons,
      and followed Buffy to UPN and still watched Angel on the WB.
++    I love this show and have them all on DVD.
+     I like it all and try to watch the reruns as much as possible.
      It is a good show, but I won't go out of my way to watch it.

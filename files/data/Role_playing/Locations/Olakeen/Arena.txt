Lethal Combat|In lethal combat the criminal is placed in the Arena with only one weapon and a shield. The fight will last until the criminal is dead or the opponent is unconscious. The opponent is a member of the Olakeen Military (two levels higher than the criminal). The opponent has a weapon, shield, and helmet. In the case where lethal combat ends with the opponent unconscious, the criminal is placed into service in the city. The service is the worst sort of work, and it is for life. The criminal will not get paid for the service.
Magical Lethal Combat|Magical lethal combat is used when a spellcaster is the criminal. The spellcaster is only allowed to memorize spells. The opponent is a spellcaster two levels higher. The combat will end when the criminal is dead or the opponent is unconscious. A spellcaster can be a mage, cleric, bard, ranger, druid, or even a paladin (it can happen), and in some cases a psionisist depending on how good the psionisist is.
Non-lethal Combat|In non-lethal combat the criminal is placed in the Arena without any weapons or armor and neither is the opponent. The opponent is usually the same level as the criminal. The fight will be until one of them is unconscious. In the case of brawling, all brawlers are put in the Arena at the same time so they can fight each other without hurting any innocents or the furniture. For added safety in case a mage or cleric is in the group, an antimagic shell is erected. After non-lethal combat, the criminals are set free with a warning.  If the criminal is found doing the same activity again, they will be put into unpaid service to the city for a month per incident.

XP Value: 2,000 GP Value: 10,000
This potent magical liquid indicates where magical items of great strength are located while the imbiber is high in the air (flying, on mountain top, the top of a shipâ€™s mast, etc.) or looking at a map of any sort. This ability lasts for 10 full years, or until the one magical item this fluid shows the drinker is found. This will function for every member of a group that drinks from the Bottle of Black Wine; otherwise the bottle and the rest of its contents disappear after the end of the fourth day in which it was opened.
2 Elixir of Berserking
This substance appears to all tests to be a potion of Super-Heroism. If imbibed the drinker gains 2 levels, 15 hit points, a +3 to attack and damage rolls, but also goes into a berserk rage attacking all living creatures in sight (including allies). The drinker also gets an AC penalty of 3 but gains a +3 to strength. The drinker attacks all moving living creatures in sight until no one is left standing (dead, unconscious, playing possum, etc). The drinker returns to normal after battle, but will re-enter a berserk state if another battle begins during the elixir's duration. The elixir lasts for 1d10 +5 turns. This elixir is only usable by warriors.

Spellcasters or creatures with magical abilities cannot use magic while in contact with the oil user. Magically animated creatures (golems, skeletons, etc.) become inanimate while being touched by the oil user. The user can breach magical barriers and wards without harm, as well as open magically locked doors and items.

__DATA__
B<Morley> became popular with its use in I<The X-Files> however the earliest known use of the brand name is in I<Psycho>. Not all series which mention Morley cross over with each other. One note of caution, the list of series was compiled on A<Wikipedia|href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morley_(cigarette)">, so some of these may not even contain Morley cigarettes (or similarly designed cigarette pack).

2 Etruscan horse
The Etruscan horse Morley was the first package design introduced, possibly on I<Psycho>. Anything using this design could be considered a crossover with I<Psycho>.

2 Red box Morley

2 Other pack designs
The Etruscan horse and Marlboro look-alike designs are not the only ones out there.
* I<Killer Instinct> Q<Game Over> (11 November 2005) has a pack that is red with a horizontal white stripe.
* I<The L-Word> Q<Lap Dance> (27 February 2005) and Q<Lunar Cycle> (16 March 2008) has packs that look a lot like the red box Morley, but Morley is spelled in all capital letters where the red box is in title case.
* I<The Strain> Q<The Third Rail> (21 September 2014) has a pack that is white with vertical gold stripes.

2 Not Morley
It could be there are those creatives who know about the popularity of the Morley brand and want to distance themselves from it, so use another name on the packaging. On I<Frasier> Q<Morning Becomes Entertainment> (6 Apirl 2000) the pack looks like Morley, but the company name is Adler.

2 Seen but unclear
Sometimes there is a pack which looks like Morley, but the angle or distance of the shot makes it impossible to tell if the pack says Morley or not.
* I<Weeds> Q<The Brick Dance> (27 August 2007)
* I<The Americans> pilot (30 January 2011)
* I<Up All Night> Q<I Can't Quit You> (6 December 2012) has cigarettes but no sign of Morley.
* I<Orange is the New Black> Q<Tall Men with Feelings> (11 July 2013)

2 Heard but not seen
Morley could be mentioned without ever showing a pack of cigarettes, making it impossible to tell where the series connects. On I<Judging Amy> Q<Can They Do That With Vegetables?> (5 February 2002) the company is mentioned, but no pack is shown.

2 Not cigarettes
No matter the pack design, I<The Dick Van Dyke Show> Q<Sally is a Girl> (19 December 1961) will not cross with any of the above groups. From the description of the appearance, the cigarettes are candy.

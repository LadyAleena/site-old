__DATA__

2 Ring of the Negative Plane
by Dan Grieg
This ring looks to be a gold ring that on half of it has a slight glow, the other half looks like it was smeared with soot.
Its first and most frightening ability is to drain two levels/HD from a creature. Not only does this drain the victim but it also transfers the levels/HD to the user of the ring affecting all level based rolls such as hit dice and saving throws. This affect only lasts for two turns. The levels are returned to the creature they were taken from. If the creature died from the draining, the creature will stay dead. This power my be used once a day.
The second power is negative plane protection. The ring works almost exactly like the spell except that the effect is always on, and if the wearer fails the save against the drain the wearer does not take double damage.
No undead can never wear this ring. The ring will burn through its finger and fall off.
2 Ring of Object Control *
This ring allows the wearer to animate any objects whose combined size would fit into a 30’ cube (i.e. 4 tables, or 1 statue, or 10 chairs). This ring essentially functions as the 6th level priest spell Animate Object, at the cost of 1 charge per use. The duration of control / animation is 5 turns. The ring typically contains 4d6 charges, and can be recharged.
2 Ring of Petrification Protection *
This ring protects the wearer from all petrification attacks. While the ring is worn, 1 charge is drained from the ring every time the wearer is subjected to a petrification attack. The ring wearer cannot decide to make a saving throw against the attack, because the ring supercedes it. The ring has 10d6 charges and can be recharged.
2 Ring of Piety *
This ring gives the wearer a +3 bonus to saving throws, a +1 bonus to wisdom, and allows him / her to memorize double the number of spells for levels 1-4. This ring only works for single class clerics, druids, or other priest classes and vanishes when removed.
2 Ring of Plant Control *
This ring allows the wearer to control plants in a 100’ radius, up to 3 times per day. The ring wearer can cause any plants in the area to move about, entangle foes, cover things, etc, up to the limit for the plant’s size (i.e. grass could not stop anyone, but a tree could reek havoc on foes.). The control lasts for up to 1 hour per use. The user may also try to control plant-like monsters, but the monster(s) receive a save vs. spells if intelligent, to avoid control. Plants that are destroyed or damaged cannot be controlled (i.e. a chopped down tree cannot do anything, neither can a cut flower). This ring is prized by druids and rangers to help them protect woodlands.
2 Ring of the Priestess
This ring is usable only by female priests. It gives the priest one additional spell per level and one non-weapon proficiency from the priest group, permanently, after one full day of meditation. It confers a +1 to Wisdom while worn.
2 Ring of Protection From Animals and Plants
This ring will protect the wearer from attacks made by normal animals and plants. It will not protect the wearer from any creatures with an intelligence of 2 or better.

This ring can only be removed by a Remove Curse cast at 15th level or higher.
2 Ring of Psionic Power *
This ring gives the wearer a +2 bonus to all power checks, and a +50% bonus to his / her total PSPs. This ring is only usable by a single class psionicist and vanishes when removed.

2 Ring of Pummeling *
This ring allows a wearer who fights with his / her fists only, to cause 1d8 damage per hit per fist (instead of the normal 1d2 damage). If the ring wearer is trained in unarmed fighting with his / her hands, he / she gains a + 2 to hit and damage, and causes an additional 1d8 damage to his / her normal barehanded damage. This ring has no charges.
2 Ring of Rage *
This ring appears to be a Ring of Strength to all tests and functions as such. The ring wearer goes berserk in combat, attacking all creatures including allies. The ring wearer continues attacking until all creatures are dead, unconscious, playing possum, or gone. Then the ring wearer returns to normal. The ring can only be removed by a Remove Curse cast at 15th level or higher.
2 Ring of Regents *
This ring allows the wearer to cast spells without the use of material components. The ring has 200 + 5d10 charges and uses up 1 charge per spell level of the cast spell (i.e. 6th level spell uses 6 charges). If the ring wearer has the material components for the spell being cast, or the spell requires no material components, the ring does not function. This ring is especially useful to Alchemists.
2 Ring of San Sao (Fighting)
by ^Gabriel Elias^
This ring is made of a blood red metal with the characters of "San Sao Chuen Shu" in gold on the inside.
When worn by a non martial artist, the Ring of San Sao gives a +2 bonus to hit when fighting in unarmed combat only and allows the wearer Crushing Blow. When worn by a pure martial artist, the character gets the above mentioned, a +2 to AC (If the wearer wear no armor), +1 damage every 4 levels, and 2 extra attacks every 5 levels. If the wearer is from Shao Lung, it also serves as a Ring of Free Action.
2 Ring of Shapechanging *
This ring grants the wearer the ability to shapechange into any creature seen before up to twice the ring wearer's mass. The user gains all the non-magical abilities (night vision, giant strength, flight, etc.), physical attributes (size, physical attacks, wings, etc.), and 1 magical ability of the chosen creature (Energy drain, breath weapon, etc.). The wearer also gains all of the vulnerabilities of the chosen form as well (i.e. a vampire would have problems with sunlight, holy water, garlic, etc.). The ring is usable up to 3 times a day, but there is no limit on the duration of a chosen form. If the user is slain while shapechanged, the user reverts to the user's true form, causing the ring to shatter. Good creatures that constantly transform into evil creatures may also have alignment penalties, at the DMs discretion.
2 Ring of Shields

2 Ring of Spell Immunity
One of these Rings only protects the wearer from one wizard spell that is targeted at the wearer. Area of effect spells will not cause the protection to activate unless the spell is targeted at the wearer. Each time it protects the wearer, it expends one charge, and there is a 12% chance the spell reflects back on the caster. These rings can not be recharged. See Counterspell Immunity spell for more information.
2 Ring of Spell Might
by Johnny Brant
This ring is made of woven unicorn hairs and bears a small golden illusion of Piper's mage sigil (a golden cat eye) inside its diamond setting. This unique ring has all the abilities of a Ring of Protection +4 (+2 to saving throws) and a Ring of Fire Resistance, and allows the wearer to cast spells as needed instead of having to memorize them as is normal for a wizard. This function of the ring works for all known spellcasters. This includes bards, paladins, priests, and rangers.
If the wearer chooses to memorize spells normally, they are cast with a reduction in their casting times. Spells memorized in this manner have their casting times reduced by 3 to a minimum of a 1 casting time.
In addition this was also subjected to Thiondar's permanent anti-magic field during its creation thus making it immune to all further magics. Protective items treated with Thiondar's permanent anti-magic field gives the wearer magic resistance equal to 20% per plus of saving throw bonuses, thus, the ring of spell might grants 80% magic resistance to its wearer.
2 Ring of Spell Stealing *
This ring appears to all tests to be a Ring of Wizardry or Ring of Holiness (DMs option). However, when the ring is put on and the extra spells memorized, the curse is activated. Whenever the ring wearer attempts to cast a spell, there is a 75% chance that the ring “eats” the spell, causing the spell to fizzle. There is also a 30% chance that the ring will dispel any active enchantments on the ring wearer (good or bad) checked once per turn. Once the ring shows its true power, it can only be removed by a Remove Curse spell cast by a spellcaster of at least 18th level.
2 Ring of Strength *
This ring raises the wearer’s strength by 1 point for as long as it is worn. This ring can be used by any class.
2 Ring of Sweetness
This ring provides its wearer with protection even in extremely acidic environments. It restores damage caused by acid at the rate of one point per turn, provides a saving throw bonus of +2 versus acid-based attacks, and reduces damage sustained by -1 per die.
2 Ring of Teleportation *
This ring allows the wearer and up to 1000lbs of living or non-living matter to Teleport (as the 5th level mage spell) once per day. The ring’s power has the same chances for error as a Teleport spell. The ring neither has nor uses charges.
2 Ring of Temporal Displacement
by ^Randy Furuyama^
When this ring is activated, the wearer is displaced back in time 1 combat round. This allows the wearer to try to correct a mistake made during combat including re-rolling an attack roll, re-wording a wish, or any other action that could change the resulting consequences. Once this function is used, the magic in the ring is expelled. The ring becomes a simple silver band worth about 10 gp. This ring cannot be recharged.
2 Ring of Thievery *
This ring gives the wearer a +3 bonus to attacks and damage, a +1 bonus to dexterity, and a +15% to all thieving abilities. The ring only works for single class thieves and bards and vanishes when removed.

2 Ring of Trollish Regeneration *

2 Ring of Truesight *
This ring allows the wearer to see things as they really are, exactly like the priest spell True Seeing. The ring can be used up to 5 times a day for up to an hour each time.

This ring contains no charges, but the wearer cannot use fire-based spells or items. Water Elementals will attempt to possess the ring attacking the wearer with preference.
2 Ring of Undead Attraction *
This ring appears to be a Ring of Draining when identified or tested, and it functions as such. When worn however, it attracts any and all intelligent undead within a 1 mile radius of the ring wearer. The undead attracted will seek to possess the ring and destroy the wearer, attacking him / her in preference to all others, unless attacked by a more powerful opponent. The ring can be removed when it runs out of charges, the user is killed, or by a Remove Curse cast at 17th level or higher.
2 Ring of Undead Control *
This ring allows the wearer to attempt to control any undead creature within a 50’ radius. The undead creature so targeted must save vs. spells become the ring wearer’s slave for up to 1 day, or until the undead creature is farther then 25’ from the ring wearer. Undead who save act as if they were turned, fleeing from the ring wearer at maximum speed for 1d6 turns. The ring wearer can command only 1 undead creature at a time, and the ring can only be used once per day. The undead creature commanded will follow the ring wearer’s directions, as long as the directions are not self-destructive (not including combat). The undead creature commanded will not divulge any information for the ring wearer, and does not have to use any spells or abilities it may possess for the ring wearer’s benefit. This ring can usurp control of undead from priests or other undead if the ring wearer is higher level than the other controlling factor.

This ring allows the wearer to transform the ring into a Purple Worm (see MM) with maximum hit points. The Purple Worm is under the ring wearer’s complete control and stays in worm form until slain, or until the ring wearer commands it back into ring form. Any damage done to the Purple Worm is permanent unless healed by a Wish spell. When the Purple Worm dies the ring turns to dust.

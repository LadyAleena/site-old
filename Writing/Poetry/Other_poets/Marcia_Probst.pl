2 The Damn
stanza When I got the news fear of the unknown made me cry.|But the rain was behind shameful hands which trembled.|I saw rocks around me, and though I felt like flowing sand in the sea I fought to hold to my place.|I was not going to die they said.  I could help myself and live a normal life.|And yet it has invaded every part of me|An infestation of myself runs rampant.
Needles, food, and blood are drowning me everyday.
stanza The call came in while I was away the day my brother and I became one in our eternal plague.|I tore and screamed and shouted aloud for all to hear and witness.|My rage was a flood cascading over everything in it's path.|He was not supposed to feel my pain and sorrow.  I was to bear it alone, as always before, while he lived a happy, healthy life.|I told him he always took my glory over the phone.|This time instead of hands, the phone hid my torrent of tears.
Together we are plunged into murky depths.
stanza Grandma is being pulled in too, but won't admit that she is standing knee deep in our pool of anguish.|I watch her deny it all each time a new wave laps around her feet.|Someday I feel the undertow will drag her, and pull her to us.|When it does I don't think she will make it.
Trickles are breaking out anew all around me.
stanza My mother at least sees the storm coming at her.|She is checking her levies, they are leaking so she is teaching herself to swim before the flood.|Her awareness adds another layer to her damn.|But will it keep it all from falling down and sweeping her away?
How did I open the floodgates on everyone I know?
stanza Who else will join us as we kick and paddle in the flow?|Will they be ready?|Run from me, I've broken the damn!
Needles, blood, and food are drowning me everyday.
2 The Edge of Insanity
stanza If I were falling off the edge of insanity who would be the one they sent to save me?|Would it be the fastest in fear that I would cascade at any moment?|Or the smartest, who could devise a plan to safely put me in the correct position?|Maybe the gentlest, who could bring me back with love and affection?|Would the strongest be sent to drag me back kicking and screaming?|Maybe a fool to show me what I may be and change the error in my ways.|Or would there be anyone at all?
2 A Fish Named Darwin
stanza I have a fish named Darwin.|I like my fish.|I feed him, provide him a home, change his water.|I wonder what it would be like to watch him in the wild.|Would his characteristics change?|I named Darwin after the scientist.|I never really found what he said wholly true.|Of course to be fair I never really studied him much either.|All the same, I like holding Darwin's life in my hands,|Or bowl actually.
2 The Guise of a Man
stanza Smile little boy.|Don't hide your fears behind the guise of a man.|If you can't let me hold you or listen, then at least let me sit near by.|You don't have to share it out loud.|But don't try to block it all in either.|You don't always have to be as strong as you want to be.|Just be as strong as you are.|In the end you will be twice the man you are trying so hard to be.
2 Holding Arms
stanza You held me last night and it felt good to be in your arms.|For those moments were special to me.|I know you don't feel the same way I do.|That's okay.|I know you have feelings for others.|That's okay.|I'll just let you hold me in your arms all the same.
stanza I held you within my own arms last night.|It felt good to know that for a moment I was the right person for you.|I know I won't always be that one.|That's okay.|I know this hasn't changed how you feel.|That's okay.|I'll just hold you until you don't need me anymore.
stanza We held each other in warms arms and cried tonight.|I was there for you and your were there for me.|I know we will probably never do it again.|That's okay.|I know it will be others who hold your heart.|That's okay.|I'll have other arms too.
2 I Dream Alone
<div class="center">
stanza When I sit alone at night I dream.|Sometimes blood curdling horrors run from the corners|And threaten to tear the flesh back from my|Mutilated soul.
stanza Sometimes I just ache with the strain|Of all of life's little whims and wants.  Feeling each fiber of|Each muscle groan at the abuse it has tolerated|One more day.
stanza An excellent bliss sometimes over comes me,|And I cannot help but smile at the ceiling in all it's glory as I|Ponder the magnificence around me. I even go so far as to|Giggle with the walls at the supreme wonder of|It all.
stanza Many times I will snuggle into the warmth|And security of my own bed. Drifting off satisfied with|How I have lived that day alone|At the very least.
stanza But a lot of the time I wish I didn't have|To dream alone|At all.
</div>
2 I Hate
stanza I hate.|Why can't you feel it's burn?|Don't cling to me and try and shape me with your love.|I hate.|Why don't you feel it consuming everything good?|Don't hold onto me and try to pull me back from my stupor.|I hate.|Why can't you see me eating your heart, consuming your soul?|Don't cry out for me and morn my losses.|I hate.|Why don't your realize I am ravaging your mind and body easily?|Don't look at me or touch me please for,|I hate.
2 Keeping the Bad Things Away
<div class="center">
When I was a little girl my mommy tucked me in at night to keep the bad things away.
When I was a teenager monsters within myself began to bump and grind causing confusion and disarray.
As a young woman I am trying to see through the gray for to where the black and white lines used to stay.
And I am beginning to understand why my mom wants to tuck me in to this day.

2 Knock at the Door
stanza Take a deep breath, how do you feel?|Is the world reaching and clawing at your toes?|Do you find yourself wondering if it is even real?|Blink and look around you, tell me did you see friends or foes?
stanza Knocking at my door the devil comes to call my name.|His face is pure and sweet, no flaw to point out it's wrong.|As the angel he was does he simply point out all of my shame.|I weep with the loss of what is not to be found and a wail of remorse is now my song.
stanza Holding up his arms he offers innocence for my devotion and love.|Standing aside he shows me his multitudes, behind him a sea.|A beautiful smile at the head of many, how am I to see he's not from above?|And with shame such as mine is it right for me to question in truth?
stanza Another knock at the door which opens to reveal the Father this time.|A grimy face looks at me in the clothes of a thug,|Filthy hands reach out to ask for my hard earned dime.|Through my mind slides real of violence past and yet he asks me to gift it all with a hug.
stanza Take a deep breath, how do you feel?|Is the world reaching and clawing at your toes?|Do you find yourself wondering if it is even real?|Blink and look around you, tell me did you see friends or foes?

2 Sometimes All It Takes

2 What I Love
I love with all my heart the memories of warmth I have of days gone past.
I love the tears I have shed unashamed in front of the harshest crowds.
I love the way a smell can take you back to grandma, or sunny days, or rainy nights.
I love the way my dad has always been a kid at heart and my mom a hopeless romantic.
I love the way the world looks with your head tilted to the side, and the smiles that look back.
And I love that I will find a million more things to love before I am through.
2 When You're Happy
<div class="center">
stanza It's funny when you're a happy person there's not much to write about.|People in love can ooze about this or that.|Mad or angry people can ramble on for hours about their rages.|Depressed people often tend to get more depressed from writing it down, and so then have much more to write about.|Although what doesn't depress depressed people?|But if you're just happy it's like your thoughts just aren't nearly good enough to put down on paper.|Or maybe it's just that we don't want the mad and depressed people to get madder and more depressed because of our bliss.|Maybe we just don't want them to write anymore.

__DATA__
B<Role playing> is one of the larger player created resources for AD&amp;D 2nd Edition material on the web. Over 250 magic items are available and categorized as they would be listed if they were in the I<Encyclopedia Magica>&#169; TSR, Inc. There are a dozen A<monsters|href="Monsters"> for dungeon masters to pit against their players. Reference tables and random generators are included to help make 2nd Edition game play easier and a little more exciting. There is a comprehensive, though not complete, list of proficiencies that TSR, Inc.&#8482; and Wizards of the Coast, Inc.&#8482; have put out over the years. Conversions to other editions are welcome.

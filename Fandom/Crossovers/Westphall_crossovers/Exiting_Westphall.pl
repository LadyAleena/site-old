__DATA__
All of these crossovers are part of the Tommy Westphall Universe. Some crossover enthusiasts have created crossovers where it does not make much sense. Here are those I consider non-crosses, however there may still be crossovers in these non-crosses.

2 Back to Westphall
I<Blossom> in the A<All in the Families|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#All_in_the_Families"> continuity had a A<small crossover|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl#Father_Guido_Sarducci"> that put it back into A<Westphall|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl">.

2 Westerns in Crisis
A<B<The Westerns> and the B<I<Arrowverse>>|href="Westerns_in_Crisis.pl"> came together through a surprising link. Both are still disconnected from Westphall, but who knows for how much longer?
2 Drag a big net
& Dragnet
by NBC and ABC
I<Dragnet> spun off a film of the same name in 1954, I<Dragnet 1967>, I<Dragnet 1966>, I<Dragnet> (1987), I<The New Dragnet>, and I<Dragnet> (2003) that was renamed I<L.A. Dragnet>.
The character Jim Reed from I<Dragnet 1967> Q<The Phony Police Racket> and Q<The Big Search> went on to appear as a regular on I<Adam-12>. Once on I<Adam-12>, he and Pete Malloy appeared on I<Dragnet 1967> Q<Internal Affairs: DR-20> and I<Emergency!> Q<Emergency!>. I<Adam-12> Q<The Radical> concludes on I<The D.A.> Q<People vs. Saydo>. I<Adam-12> spun off I<The New Adam-12>.
I<The D.A.> is a spin off of two television films: I<The D.A.: Murder One> and I<The D.A.: Conspiracy to Kill>.
John Gage and Roy DeSoto from I<Emergency!> appeared on I<Adam-12> Q<Lost and Found> and I<Sierra> Q<The Urban Rangers>. I<Emergency!> spun off six television films. I<Emergency!> Q<The Stewardess> used stock footage of A<Trans Global Airlines|href="Big_fake_companies#Trans_Global_Airlines"> from I<Airport 1975>.

2 No News for the Detectives
A A<crossover|href="http://tommywestphall.livejournal.com/25863.html"> was attempted between I<Columbo>, I<^Wonder Woman (1975)^>, I<^Matt Houston^>, I<^Remington Steele^>, I<^Moonlighting^>, I<City of Angels>, I<Burke's Law> (1994), and I<24> A<&#9664;|href="Departing_from_Westphall.pl#twenty-four"> for allegedly using the I<Los Angeles Tribune>, the fictional newspaper from I<Lou Grant>. With the amount of networks involved and no discernible connections, I do not see this as a crossover.
3 Mary Tyler Moore
& Mary Tyler Moore
from CBS
I<The Mary Tyler Moore Show> spun off four series: I<Rhoda>, I<Phyllis>, I<Lou Grant>, and I<Mary and Rhoda>.A<&#9660;|href="#Im_not_home" title="I&#700;m Not Home!">

2 Hudson University
Some series have been linked from a mention of the fictional A<Hudson University|href="../Big_fake_companies#Hudson_University">. Hudson University is too generic to be considered for a crossover. However, if any of these series have the same logo for Hudson University on something like stationary, I would consider it a crossover. The following series do not cross because of Hudson University.
* I<Murder, She Wrote> A<&#9664;|href="Departing_from_Westphall.pl#Original_series_crossovers" title"Magnum P.I.">
* I<Degrassi: The Next Generation> Q<Broken Wings>
* I<Tru Calling>
* I<The Secret Life of the American Teenager>
* I<Blue Bloods>
* I<Unforgettable>
* I<Beauty &amp; the Beast>
* I<Arrow> A<&#9664;|href="../Westerns_in_Crisis.pl#Arrowverse" title="Arrowverse">
* I<The Mysteries of Laura>
* I<Blindspot>
* All the following, while not contiguous with the above, are contiguous with each other in A<Westphall|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl"> through other connections.

** I<Castle> A<&#9664;|href="Departing_from_Westphall.pl#Fringe" title="Fringe">
2 I'm not home!
Many series have been linked because of the series I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!>. I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!> takes the characters out of their original continuities and places them into another. Since they are outside their original continuity, they are not the same characters. So the following do I<not> cross with each other or anything above.
* I<The Donna Reed Show> or I<Dennis The Menace> though they did cross.
* I<The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis>
* I<Hazel>
* I<The Munsters> and its spin-offs
* I<My Mother the Car>
* I<The Flying Nun>
* I<Get Smart> A<&#9660;|href="#McHales_U.N.C.L.E._Gets_Smart" title="McHale's U.N.C.L.E. Gets Smart">

* All the following, while not contiguous with the above, are contiguous with each other in A<Westphall|href="Westphall_crossovers.pl"> through other connections.

2 Real people
I<^Adventures of Superman^> did not cross with I<I Love Lucy>  Q<Lucy and Superman> when George Reeves appeared. He was playing himself, though for the children in the audience, it was made to appear as if he were playing Superman.
3 Two and a Half, Bang!
I<Two and a Half Men> Q<Fish in a Drawer> did not crossover with I<CSI: Crime Scene Investigation>.A<&#9664;|href="Departing_from_Westphall.pl#CSI" title="CSI"> I<CSI: Crime Scene Investigation> Q<Two and a Half Deaths> did not crossover with I<Two and a Half Men> because Jon Cryer, Charlie Sheen, and Angus Jones appeared as themselves.A<&#9650;|href="../index.pl#People_not_considered" title="people not considered">

I<The Big Bang Theory> spun off I<Young Sheldon>.
2 Other
A crossover between I<The Dick Van Dyke Show> and I<Richard Diamond, Private Detective> was attempted with Sam played by Mary Tyler Moore on I<Richard Diamond>. Mary Tyler Moore played Laura Petrie on I<The Dick Van Dyke Show>.
A crossover between I<^St. Elsewhere^> and I<Julia> was attempted, however, the Dr. Morton Chegley characters were played by two different actors who have a nearly fifty year age difference.
3 <i>ALF</i> does not crossover
I<The Bob Newhart Show> did not cross with I<ALF> Q<Going Out of My Head Over You> since Alf mentioned I<The Bob Newhart Show>. I<ALF> did not cross with I<Mr. Robot> Q<eps2.4_m4ster-s1ave.aes> since Alf appeared in a fantasy or dream sequence.

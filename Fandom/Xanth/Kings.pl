These are the Kings and other rulers of B<Xanth>.
2 Kings of Human Xanth
Ivy is the current King of Xanth. There are no ruling queens; so no matter gender, the ruler of Xanth is King. The power of Sorceresses is equal to the power of Magicians; so when a woman becomes King, she is referred to as Magician. King Jonathan had the longest reign of 100 years, since he was a zombie. King Humfrey had the shortest reign of 19 years.

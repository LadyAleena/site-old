__DATA__
This is a collection of my notes about the B<I<Riftwar Cycle>> by A<Raymond E. Feist|href="../../Collections/Fiction.pl#Raymond_E._Feist">. There are different worlds with many nations and races; the primary worlds being A<Midkemia|href="Midkemia.pl"> and A<Kelewan|href="Kelewan.pl">. On these worlds are many races and gods. If some of this looks vaguely familiar, I started a lot of articles on Wikipedia that have since been deleted, so I am bringing the information here.

2 Common race
B<Humanity> on Midkemia and Kelewan is as diverse as it is on Earth, with many clear analogues to real-world cultures, from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Humans did not originate on these worlds, they fled to them through rifts in space-time when the Valharu rose up to challenge the gods. Since then, the humans have flourished into the dominant race on those planets.

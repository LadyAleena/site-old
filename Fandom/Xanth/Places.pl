2 Ida's Moons
B<Ida's Moons> were first introduced in I<Yon Ill Wind>. Ptero through Torus were explored in I<Faun and Games>. Cone through Motes were introduced in I<Zombie Lover>. Trapezoid through Fractal were introduced in I<Up in a Heavel>. There is a version of Ida on each moon with the next moon in the sequence. It was discovered the moons are not an endless line, but a loop, ending with a Xanth moon.
3 Those in known order
# B<Ptero> is a tiny moon the size of a ping pong ball which orbits Princess Ida's head. All the characters who ever existed, will exist, or might exist in Xanth live here. It was named by Karen Baldwin.
# B<Pyramid> is a four sided pyramid where each triangular face is a different color blue, red, green, and gray. Generosity is power here.
# B<Torus> is shaped like a doughnut. One who does a service for another comes to like that person or even love them. If you arrange to exchange favors, they cancel out.
# B<Cone> is a world of crossbreeds. People live on both the inside and outside of the cone. The inside is filled with water and people can breathe in it. All breeding must be done at the rim. Ida lives at the inside point of the cone and is also a crossbreed with the body of a human and the head of a horse.
# B<Dumbbell> is where magic is related to physical strength.
# B<Pincushion> is where all inhabitants live on the pins. Travel here is faster using a flew, which is a bug which makes you sneeze and fly for two minutes.
# B<Spiral> looks like a galaxy.
# B<Tangle> looks like knots of spaghetti.
# B<Motes> is a swarm of small fragments, each big enough to hold a small village. It has a Mote Monster who particularly has a taste for new visitors.
# B<Trapeziod>
# B<Shoe> has every old woman and many children, so no one knew what to do.
# B<Implosion>
# B<Puzzle>
# B<Octopus>
# B<Tesseract> is a 4-dimensional hyper cube. 81 cubes, all the same size, all in one box, which are unlocked by square dancing.

If cornered and without other options, they can turn gaseous for 1d6 rounds as a random gas type. The gas type can be anything from chlorine gas to ordinary fog. The gas roughly keeps its shape. If one is disarmed, it will fly away to safety if it can.|Chaos Elemental-kin are born as a random creature. They have 1d100 lives and can change form 1d100 times in each life. Upon death chaos elemental-kin will assume the body of the nearest unborn creature of its gender no matter what the creature is. The creature could be anything from a common housefly to a dragon.\Chaos Elemental-kin are reckless to a point. They do not have any reason to be except they have a feeling they will continue after their death.\Each Chaos Elemental-kin has a 50% chance of remembering its immediate past life. To remember its entire history, the chance of knowing is its current intelligence.\The body of a Chaos Elemental-kin will age and die allowing the creature to move onto a new form.\They do not form communities. If two meet they may share a drink or try to kill each other. If two mate the child will be a new Chaos Elemental-kin. If one mates with a normal creature, there is a 50% chance the child will be one. Parenting is not its forte, unless it is an instinctively parental creature.|They are creatures of chaos. No one knows how long one can live or how to kill one completely. Even they don't know how they can be completely killed. Some say they were first spawned with the creation of the multiverse, others say that they are the souls of chaotic creatures who can not rest. Those who remember all their past lives have not revealed what they know of their creation.|Half Kin can turn gaseous, but it is always a non lethal gas. They can fly for up to an hour. Their appearance is not as visible as their parent. Their hair is a more natural color with only a slight metallic tinge. Their eyes look natural with only a light oily sheen to them.

They usually attack with a weapon using their strength (19, +3 to attack, +7 to damage). If they lack a weapon, they will lash out with their sheathed claws inflicting grievous wounds. If they do not attack in melee, they use their gaze to charm an individual as per the Charm Person Spell at will.

They can interbreed with other races, but they prefer humans over any other race.\They usually live alone. If more than one is encountered, it is usually a paring for reproduction only. They do not marry and are polygamous.

Some have been known to stop their transformations and stay in this third form, but that is very rare.|Demi-Lycanthropes will attack with the natural weapons of their forms and do damage like that of their natural counterparts. They wield no other weapons. There is a 1% chance per bite attack that they can cause a more terrifying form of lycanthropy.

They are hunted by rangers, druids, and others who are concerned with the natural order of things.|No one knows where the demi-lycanthropes came from. There are many types of demi-lycanthrope. Some speculate that they were created when a natural animal was bitten by a true lycanthrope. Others think that they were some arcane experiment gone wrong.

It is believed to be able to destroy entire solar systems in one fell swoop thanks to its unimaginably powerful breath weapon. It is able to control all the elements and then some. Its only attack is its breath weapon. No one who has faced this has ever been able to defeat it. The best strategy so far seems to be not to annoy it in the first place.|Its living habits remain a mystery. It just wanders through space. One thing is known, on its regular visits to any planet, all the dragons fall quiet. Even the mighty king dragons fall silent and bow their heads.

Their hands and feet have more webbing than that of the Sea-Elf and less than that of a Triton. This race was not a magical creation, so they emanate no magic if without magic items.|Eldent are 90% resistant to sleep/charm spells and 45% resistant to all other spells. They are normally armed with tridents or spears. They do not go out of their way to start a fight and will only fight when their home or community, which includes approximately a 5 mile radius around the community, is in danger. Sometimes they are mounted on hippocampi (65%) or giant sea horses (35%). They travel with 1d3 dolphins per every 20 Eldent encountered. They will not attack to kill just to capture. If one of their number is killed, the battle will become one of retribution. They may not kill the person but will make life difficult while they are underwater.|There is only one community of Eldent on Peldeta. They live in the Sea of Eldent. They are considered an abomination to both the Sea Elven and Triton communities. The Sea Elves or Tritons that do visit stay since they may not be welcomed back home again.\The Eldent are sociable and do not mind visitors though they will be wary at first because of the threat of attack from either of the "parent" races. They normally live peaceful lives tending to their everyday affairs.|They live very closely with the underwater life like the Sea Elves and Tritons. Their race was formed from a union of a Triton Prince and a Sea Elven Princess. Since then more Tritons and Sea Elves have joined the community, but that is on the decline since the Sea Elven and Triton communities have made it almost impossible for those that just visit their community to come home again. The race now flourishes through its own people, so no new pairings with the parent races are needed to continue the species.|The only variants in this community are those that have more of one parent race in them. Some may be more Elven, and some may be more Triton. That is about the extent of the variants, though all members of the race are treated equally.|

They are about 9' tall but change appearance according to the element they are composed of at the time which could be fire, water, earth, air, light, or dark.|In combat they are fearless and their behavior can never be anticipated as different elemental states bring different fighting behavior. With fire they behave very much like a savage beast, snarling and snapping. In their water form, they are more relaxed. Also different states bestow different attributes. When in a earth form, they become very difficult to damage, but in air they become nearly impossible to hit. Each form has a breath weapon that does 6d6 points of damage. They are immune to spells that are based on their current elements. Below is a list of their different forms.\Fire: These phase-elementals behave like a wild animals. Any damage with melee weapons harms the attacker as well due to searing flames.\Water: These phase-elementals attack normally and take only half damage from all weapons. They regenerate 1 hp/rd. They are very calm, almost serene, but will attack when provoked.\Earth: These phase-elementals can not be hurt by slashing or piercing weapons. Blunt weapons only do half the die rolls of damage. Only the magical bonuses of any weapons do full damage. They can not move when in this form as they take on the forms of some type of hollow earthen tubes like termite mounds. They use those tubes to hurl exploding boulders which have an area of effect 3d6 damage at the center, 2d6 between 2' and 7', and 1d6 at 7' to the 10' radius.\Air: These phase-elementals are erratic. They can not seem to stay still and are hard to see unless one travels over dust. They take full damage from metal and stone weapons and only half damage from wooden or bone weapons. They appear to be a human shaped tornado. They move 300' in a round and can fly.\Light: These phase-elementals behave like water phase-elementals. They regenerate 1 hp a round. While all other phase elementals do damage, these to not. Their "attacks" are actually beneficial. They appear as blinding white light that moves 300' a round.\Dark: These phase-elementals are more menacing. They stand silent and have a fear aura. When once is encountered, the PC must make a Wisdom check each round or flee. Their attacks drain hit points from the PC which they use to heal themselves. They can move 300' a round. They appear to be three dimensional shadows sticking out of the ground.|Unknown.|They live everywhere, but choose not to let it be known. Only those deemed worthy by the phase elementals become aware of their presence. They live nomadic lives. If one is defeated but not destroyed, it will bind itself to the victor to be summoned at will.||Created by <a href="mailto:Grieverlionheart@hotmail.com">Alan Gray</a> with modifications by me.

There are seven varieties of rainbow dragonettes each a different color. They are not automatically hostile and are very skittish. They will attack if they feel threatened, which is often, since they are so small. They are highly intelligent and love to hear nice things. If one is treated nicely, the dragonette would even sit on a person's shoulder and croon in his ear.\At birth they are a very bright in coloration. As they grow older, their scales will first take on a metallic sheen, then at Venerable, their scales twinkle in the light. They have the ability to talk to each other, and there is a 5% cumulative chance, per level above juvenile, that one can speak common. Their language is very close to the common language of all dragons.|Dragonettes will not immediately attack. If there is more than one attacker, they will flee using their innate ability to teleport. If they are forced to attack, they first try to use their spell(s). If that does not dissuade an attacker, they will fly at high speeds and hit with their small breath weapon. They will also attack with their claws and try to bite from behind usually going for exposed necks. They will act in concert using telepathy if more than one is encountered. They can not use their telepathy with any other race.\<strong>Breath Weapon/special abilities:</strong> Dragonettes' breath weapons are listed below. Creatures struck by them must save verses Breath Weapon for half damage. A dragonette casts its spells and uses its magical abilities at 1st level plus combat modifier.\&odf_table\From birth, dragonettes are immune to prismatic spells and other effects (see chart). As they age they gain the following additional powers:\<strong>Juvenile:</strong> Color Spray once per day.\ <strong>Adult:</strong> Continual Light/Darkness once per day.\<strong>Very Old:</strong> Hypnotic Pattern once per day.\<strong>Great Wyrm:</strong> Flash once per day.|Dragonettes are very new to the world, so can be only found in the home of their creator. In time they may be found everywhere and will most likely take up residence in temperate climates. They are carnivorous and will only eat fresh kills.\They are very protective of their young. Since they are a new species, they will protect any of their species in trouble. When more than one are encountered, there will usually be a mature adult with a variety of younger dragonettes. Dragonettes mate with the first dragonette of its kind of the opposite gender. They do not mate for life.|Dragonettes do not yet have a place in the ecology of the world. They were created by a wizard who had a passion for rainbows and dragons. They are not that different from each other because the wizard that created them did not have that much imagination.\If a nest of dragonette eggs are found and hatch, feed them immediately with pieces of meat. If a person does this, they become empathically linked with the dragonette. This bond is similar to a wizard's familiar. The only difference is when the person dies, the dragonette will follow the bondmate in death. If the dragonette dies, the bondmate will have to make a constitution check. If the check is failed, the person will be rendered unconscious for 1d4 days. Afterwards the person then makes a wisdom check. Failing the check means the person is rendered insane.\Bonded dragonettes are very loyal to their partner going so far as to guide their bondmates out of trouble. Charisma is not an issue, but an abused dragonette can leave his bond mate at any time. After five days of separation, the empathic link will start to fade and the dragonette will become wild.\Dragonettes make perfect messengers. With their innate teleportational ability, they can travel to and from places they have been to before. They can carry small objects like scrolls or potions.\&age_table||This monster was inspired by the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffery.

The strongest is always the leader, most of the time a male, but females have been known to beat out a male competitor.\They can be fighters, shamans, mages, or fighter/mages. There are no thieves because of their body construction. They do not feel a need for a god, so they have no priests.

They wear dark leather with a few modifications for their wings.\When they are first encountered, they look like oversized Goblins until they unfurl their wings. They can fly for short distances and do so frequently when they are traveling. They are not that good at flying since they are still a new race getting used to their wings.|They can not tolerate bright sunlight and fight with a -1 to their attack rolls while they are in it. They have Infravision for 60'. They can use any weapon but prefer spears and maces. They are most likely going to be wearing leather armor.\Because of their Harpy ancestry, they have the ability to charm all humans and demihumans but only half as well as a Harpy. Those who fail their saving throw vs. Spells proceed towards the Gobpry. Unlike the Harpy when attacked the victim gets another saving throw vs. Spells. They can not sing while in melee. The song can be fended off with the proper preparation.\They use their talons when they do not have their weapons on them. The talons do 2-5 points of damage each, and they can attack with both sets of talons in one round.\When the Gobpry is killed, the charm spell is nullified.|They make their lairs in coastal regions or in high mountains. The lairs are always filthy with debris everywhere. They do not have a pecking order but know who is better at what in their tribe. They live communally in their lairs. Sometimes they live with other Goblin tribes, and if they are, the Gobpry is usually in command of the tribe because of their superior abilities and their ability to charm. If they have any Harpies in their lairs, they just leave the Harpy alone and act as if the Harpy is not there.\The females, who call themselves Harblins, are more like Harpies than they like.

They will attack with little provocation, but they will flee when it looks as if they are loosing the fight.\Their hides are rubbery and scale-like with a green-brown hue. They blend well in forest-like surroundings. Their arms almost touch the ground. They seem frail but are surprisingly strong and agile. They have an 80% chance of climbing sheer cliffs successfully. They walk with a slight tilt towards the front. They have very short prehensile tails and small horns, ranging from tan to white, growing from the top of their heads.\When they speak, their language sounds like a smattering of common, goblin, orc, and hobgoblin with a strange yapping intermixed.|The trobold approach to combat uses basic trickery. They often hurl javelins and spears preferring not to close until they see their enemies have been weakened. Trobolds attack in waves. Trobolds are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when possible.\They set up crude concealed pits with spikes and other basic traps. They usually have view ports and murder holes near these traps so they can pour flaming oil, missile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims.\Trobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins, short swords, and spears. Chiefs and guards tend to have the best weapons available. Trobolds will attack with two clawed hands and their bite if they lose their weapon.\Trobolds have 60-foot infravision but do not see well in bright sunlight suffering a -1 on their attack rolls. Trobolds regenerate starting five rounds after first blood. The creatures recover 1 hit point per round until healed. Those reduced to 0 or fewer hit points fall to the ground incapacitated but not slain. Incapacitated trobolds continue to regenerate and stand up to fight as soon as they have a positive number of hit points.\When using an edged weapon, it is possible to sever the thin limbs of a trobold (a natural 20 with an edged weapon is needed). Severed limbs continue to fight after separation from the body (hands squeeze, heads bite if stepped on, etc.). Attacks by severed limbs are at -2 normal chances to hit. Separated limbs fight for the remainder of the battle, then scuttle back and rebind with the body once the battle is over. Limbs unable to reach the body die within 12 hours, but this is of little consequence since trobolds regenerate lost body parts (including the head) within a two weeks. If a trobold is dismembered and scattered, the largest surviving piece regenerates. The others die within half a day if they cannot rejoin that piece. Only fire and acid cause permanent damage to trobolds. These forms of attack destroy their regenerative ability. A trobold reduced to 0 or fewer hit points and immersed in acid or burned with fire is killed.\Trobolds have no fear of death and launch themselves into combat flailing wildly at their opponents and biting whoever comes closest. If confronted by a large natural or magical fire, trobolds try to find some way around the flames. Trobolds combine a ravenous appetite with limited intelligence, so they are frequently distracted and break off pursuit 25% of the time to pick up food dropped by fleeing prey.|Trobolds live in dark, damp places underground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost any climate. As trobolds are good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement. Inside a trobold cave are a number of nests made of straw and grass plus scattered bones and treasure from victims.\The average trobold tribe has 40-400 (4d10x10) adult males. For every 40 trobolds in a band, there will be one leader and two bodyguards (AC 6; HD 1-1; hp 4 each; damage 1-6). In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, females equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the males and 30-300 (3d10x10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 guards (AC 5; HD 1+1; hp 7 each; damage 1-8). Further, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5 wild boars (AC 7; HD 3+3; damage 3d4 gore) or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels (AC 6; HD 3+3; damage 2d6 bite and blood drain). There may be one or more females who act as shamans. The shamans casts priest spells at 7th level; spheres typically include Charm, Divination, Sun (Darkness only), and Weather. Females give birth to a single trobold about once every two years.\Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into packs. As many as 5 families can be part of a pack, and each pack usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius from the lair. Trobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their victims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some rate instances, trobolds will not kill their victims but will sell them as slaves.\Trobolds have large appetites and eat anything from simple grubs to bears and humans. Their lairs are often located near human settlements or along well traveled roads, but not too near, for trobolds respect organized resistance by fire-bearing humans.\Trobolds are distrustful of strangers.|Read <a href="The_Creation_of_Monsters.pl">The Creation of Monsters</a>.||

They can engage multiple opponents when in melee. If they happen to have a weapon, it is usually a battle axe and does +8 to damage. Tralgs regenerate slowly. Starting at five rounds after the first wound, they regenerate 1 point of damage per round, but only when in water. Their limbs die after five rounds unless they are reattached. Limbs can be severed with a slashing weapon on a roll of a natural 20, but only if the natural 20 is 5 above the tralg's armor class.

They will snare the unwary and keep them for later. They live in small tribes with a chieftan. The chieftan has the best weapons and food and might wear armor. Since they see everything as food, they keep very few other creatures around for any other function. The only creatures they purposefully avoid are ice and snow tolls, frost giants, and twargs.

There is a 50% chance one can speak "trollspeak" or desert giant, a 10% chance one can speak one of the dialects of the other two tralg races, and a 5% chance one can speak the common tongue of giants or common.|These tralgs hide in the sand and rise up to pummel their prey with spears, doing +8 points additional damage, then they attack with their claws. They can engage multiple opponents when in melee. Tralgs regenerate slowly. Starting at five rounds after the first wound, they regenerate 1 point of damage per round. Their limbs die after five rounds unless they are reattached. Limbs can be severed with a slashing weapon on a roll of a natural 20, but only if the natural 20 is 5 above the tralg's armor class. They do not wear armor.\They are immune to heat and cold. They take half damage from normal fire, they take normal damage from magical fire, and double damage from water based attacks. Acid, magical fire, and normal water are the only ways to keep these creatures from regenerating.|They live in desert caves near oases and well traveled routes. They will snare the unwary and keep them for later. They are also known for polluting all water in their territories to weaken their prey. They live in small bands with a chieftan. The chieftan has the best weapons and food and might wear armor.\Since they see everything as food, they keep very few other creatures around for any other function. The only creatures they purposefully avoid are desert tolls, desert giants, and twargs. They will not impinge on their territories unless they are extremely hungry, and even then they will not attack them just their stores.|Read <a href="The_Creation_of_Monsters.pl">The Creation of Monsters</a>.

There are a few small communities they will defend from unwated visitors.\Their skin varies from a light tan to a deep brown. Their hair ranges from brown to black, turning gray with age, which they wear long but out of the way. The males wear short beards, the females do not grow them. Their eyes are either gray, brown, or black. Their clothing is functional with little ornamentation. They rarely use dye.\They make very good leather armor. It is rare to see a twarg wearing metal armor for it takes too much metal to make it, which they use to make their weapons.\Their language is a hybrid of hill giant and hill dwarf. There is a 50% chance one can speak hill giant or hill dwarf, a 10% chance one can speak one of the dialects of the other two twarg races, and a 5% chance the common giant or dwarven tongues or common.|Hill twargs prefer to fight from cover. If a few well thrown rocks do not scare off the attackers, they will attack with their long daggers which do 1d6 points of damage.\They never travel alone. If one is encountered, there will be two or more in hiding. If they are forced into melee combat and feel they are outmatched, they will try to parley for a truce. If their opponents keep coming, the twargs will fight. If they are close to their village, one will always run for aid.\If they are encountered in Triador, the only time they will fight to the death is against priests of Miskel.|Hill twargs try to live peaceful lives. They live in small communities, with no more than 200 congregating in one place. When a community becomes to large, a group will break off and settle somewhere else. Once a new community is formed, lines of communication are formed between them and the parent community.\They usually live in old abandoned mines or cave systems. The community will grow outward from there, so it would appear a town has grown out from the caves. They cultivate fields and herds for food. They also hunt when they are founding a new home for themselves. After establishing a new home, the hunting usually drops off in favor of their herds.\Males and females both fight to protect the community. There is no difference in the fighting styles between the two groups.\It takes a long while for them to really trust their neighbors, but they try to live at peace with them.|Read <a href="The_Creation_of_Monsters.pl">The Creation of Monsters</a>.

Their hair is usually brown with a greenish tint. Their skin is a dark yellow-brown, like the sun falling on the bare earth or tree trunks in the forest.

They do not farm as extensively as the other twargs either. They prefer to hunt. They may have a few small gardens to supplement their meals.\These twargs are the most accepted by their "parent" races. They hunt side-by-side with either or even both groups. Their communities are cleaner than jungle giants, and their bodies are cleaner than the wild dwarves. There are times when jungle giants (1-3), a hunting band of wild dwarves, or both may be in residence.

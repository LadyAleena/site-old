! Appearance
Jungle twargs are not as bulky as their hill and mountain cousins. Their hair is usually brown with a greenish tint. Their skin is a dark yellow-brown, like the sun falling on the bare earth or tree trunks in the forest. They dress for function only, which means they wear very little.
Their language is a hybrid of jungle giant and wild (jungle) dwarf. There is a 50% chance one can speak jungle giant or wild dwarf, a 10% chance one can speak one of the dialects of the other two twarg races, and a 5% chance the common giant or dwarven tongues or common.
! Combat
They fight like the hill twargs but they prefer to use long bows instead of daggers. Their arrows are almost certainly poisoned (save vs. paralyzation or be stunned for 2-12 rounds).
! Habitat/Society
They have smaller communities than their hill twarg cousins with no more than 100 living in one place. These twargs do not live in caves or even buildings. They build only to keep their stores and themselves dry when it rains. They prefer to live and work in the open air. They do not farm as extensively as the other twargs either. They prefer to hunt. They may have a few small gardens to supplement their meals.
These twargs are the most accepted by their "parent" races. They hunt side-by-side with either or even both groups. Their communities are cleaner than jungle giants, and their bodies are cleaner than the wild dwarves. There are times when jungle giants (1-3), a hunting band of wild dwarves, or both may be in residence. They may not stay long but are always welcome.

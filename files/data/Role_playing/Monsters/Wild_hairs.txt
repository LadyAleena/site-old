! Appearance
Wild Hairs are nescience creatures.  They attack randomly with no sound and 100% chance to surprise.
! Combat
There may be a slight chance to notice the wild hairs.  They usually attack when someone is in a really good mood or a really vicious one.  They also attack when there is a lull in conversation and one person seems to be bored.
Sometimes they attack and are good for the person they are attacking, but that is rare.
There is no known way to kill a wild hair. They cause a person to act without reason. The only way to avoid doing what they want is to make successful ability score checks. This is ALL ability scores must be checked against. A person needs to be strong enough to pull free of their embrace, dexterous enough to dodge their second attack, have a constitution of iron to successfully stop the dizziness that will occur when trying to suppress the wild hair's suggestions, intelligent not to fall for the suggestions, wise enough to not open the mouth, and charismatic enough to smooth over the off chance that the wild hair's suggestions get through.
The wild hair attacks in a particularly vulnerable spot, the butt.  No one knows why they attack that body part only. Most people will know when they have been attacked, since they will normally say they got a wild hair up their ass.
! Ecology
It is said that they are hairs that fall off of Invisible Stalkers that have gone through wild magic zones.  They propagate by the amount of havoc they cause.  The more havoc they cause, the more wild hairs there will be.

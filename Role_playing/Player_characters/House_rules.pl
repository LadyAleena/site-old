__DATA__
My group had a lot of house rules I am trying to remember. Here are some of them so you understand some of the weirdness you may come across with my characters.
2 Rolls
We would roll 4d6 and reroll 1s and keep the highest 3 dice 7 times and drop the lowest of the 7.
2 Classes
Humans can multiclass and there are no level restrictions for non-human characters.
2 Proficiencies
The number of languages is applied to both languages and non-weapon proficiencies. We add the initial proficiency slots each time a new level is gained.
2 Bonus Spells
We use bonus spells from wisdom and apply it to intelligence for wizards to gain additional spells. So a wizard with a 17 intelligence would get two additional first level spells, two additional second level spells, and one additional third level spell.
I have always thought the original bonus spells were a tad unbalanced. More fourth level spells were added as bonus spells than any other level even the ones below it. So, I rewrote the bonus spell list as shown below. Only four scores have changed.

+++++ I am the person who sued Emmerich and Devlin when they stole my idea.
++++  I am either Emmerich, Devlin, or Richard Dean Anderson.
+++   I started watching the show on Showtime, know all of the binary designations of all the planets visited,
      complain bitterly when the Sci-Fi channel plays the episodes out of order, and want a Stargate of my own.
++    I love this show, have them all on DVD, and was depressed when Michael Shanks left the show for a season.
+     I loved the movie, and the show does it some justice.
      It is just another show.
-     It will never work, Star Trek kicks its butt.
--    Do we really need another MacGyver?
---   When will this show just die!

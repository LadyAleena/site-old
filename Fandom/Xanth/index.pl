__DATA__
This is a collection of my notes about the B<I<Xanth>> series I have gathered. There are many major A<families|href="Families.pl">, A<kings|href="Kings.pl">, A<places|href="Places.pl">, and A<species|href="Species.pl">. This section also covers I<The Apprentice Adept> and I<Incarnations of Immortality> series, since they have become tangentially connected to Xanth.
If some of this looks familiar, I started a lot of Xanth related articles on Wikipedia. Several of them have now been deleted, but I was able to save my work here. This section is very incomplete; there is a lot that is covered in the forty-one novels.
2 Novels
The novels begin in the Xanthian year of ^1042^ and are currently in the year ^1117^. Many novels cover events that happened before 1042. You can read the A<timeline|href="Timeline.pl"> to get a brief overview of the history of Xanth.

I want to thank Douglas Harter for all of his work putting together the list of characters on A<HiPiers|href="http://www.HiPiers.com">. I could not have completed the family trees without him.

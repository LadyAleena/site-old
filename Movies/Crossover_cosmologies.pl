__DATA__
I hope you enjoy these crossover cosmologies. I have included official and unoffical crossovers. Some may be in dispute. There are two sites which helped me in putting this together. First is Thomas Holbrook's site A<Crossovers and Spin Offs|href="http://www.poobala.com/crossoverlistb.html">. Second is Keith Gow's and Ash Crowe's site A<The Tommy Westphall Universe|href="https://thetommywestphall.wordpress.com">. Without those two resources, I would not be as far along as I am now. There are a few places where I have disagreed with Holbrook, Gow, and Crowe; but I am still very thankful for their work.

4 Before and after the Montecito
You may think that is enough, but it is not quite over. I<Passions> and I<The Office> bring more into this cosmology. Let’s visit them.

Are the two brands of Morelys supposed to be the same brand just repackaged? If they are the same brand, then I<Mission: Impossible> and I<The X-Files> cross.

Keaton of I<Family Ties> was mentioned on I<Spin City>. I<Spin City> Q<Internal Affairs> ended with a segue into I<Sports Night>. Paul Lassiter from I<Spin City> appeared on I<Something So Right> Q<Something About the 'Men' in Menstruation>.
I<Married with Children> spun off I<Top of the Heap> which was renamed I<Vinnie & Bobby>. Marcy Rhoades D’Arcy from I<Married with Children> appeared on I<Nikki> Q<Technical Knockup>.
2 The News and the Detectives
The following cosmologies may all be connected through the I<Los Angeles Tribune>, the fictional newspaper from I<Lou Grant>. Let's start from the beginning, shall we?
3 <i>Mary Tyler Moore</i>
I<Mary Tyler Moore> spun off four series. I<Rhoda> was first, then I<Phyllis>, then I<Lou Grant>, then I<Mary and Rhoda>.
3 <i>Columbo</i>
I<Columbo> spun off I<Mrs. Columbo>. I<Mrs. Columbo> went through a lot of name changes. The first name change was to I<Kate Columbo>. The next change was to I<Kate the Detective>. When the show ended it was I<Kate Loves a Mystery>.
3 <i>Burke's Law</i>
I<Burke's Law> (1963) spun off I<Amos Burke, Secret Agent> which spun off I<Burke's Law> (1994). The titular character of I<Honey West> appeared on I<Burke's Law> (1963) Q<Who Killed the Jackpot?> and I<Burke's Law> (1994) Q<Who Killed Nick Hazard?>.
3 <i>Moonlighting</i>
Max from I<Hart to Hart> appeared on I<Moonlighting> Q<It's a Wonderful Job>. In the next I<Moonlighting> episode, Q<The Straight Poop>, Pierce Brosnan from I<Remington Steele> makes an appearance as himself, which negates a crossover here.
3 The crossover
I<Columbo>, I<Wonder Woman>, I<Matt Houston>, I<Remington Steele>, I<Moonlighting>, I<City of Angels>, I<Burke's Law> (1994), and I<24> allegedly read the I<Los Angeles Tribune> from I<Lou Grant>. (I can't prove A<this crossover|href="http://tommywestphall.livejournal.com/25863.html">.)
2 JAG and NCIS
I<JAG> started off on NBC before going to CBS.
Edward Sheffield from I<JAG> first appeared on I<First Monday> in three episodes.
I<JAG> Q<Ice Queen> and Q<Meltdown> were the backdoor pilot for I<NCIS>.
I<NCIS> two-part Q<Legend> was the backdoor pilot to I<NCIS: Los Angeles>. I<NCIS> two-part Q<Crescent City> was the backdoor pilot to I<NCIS: New Orleans>.
G. Callen and Sam Hannah from I<NCIS: Los Angeles> appeared on I<Hawaii 5-0> Q<Pa Make Loa> which concluded on I<NCIS: Los Angeles> Q<Touch of Death> with Daniel Williams and Chin Ho Kelly from I<Hawaii 5-0> appearing.
Hetty Lange from I<NCIS: Los Angeles> appeared on I<Scorpion> Q<True Colors>.
2 EWA
Anyone who watches the Syfy channel knows that on Monday nights they aired three television series I<A<EurSUP<e>ka|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=EWA#EUReKA">>, I<A<Warehouse 13|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=EWA#Warehouse_13">>, and I<A<Alphas|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=EWA#Alphas">>. Some might not be aware that these three series have formed a crossover cosmology which I call A<EWA|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=EWA">.
Let’s look at the three crossovers between I<Eureka> and I<Warehouse 13>. The first crossover between the two is I<Warehouse 13> Q<13.1>. The second crossover is I<Eureka> Q<Crossing Over>. The third crossover is I<Warehouse 13> Q<Don’t Hate the Player>. The two series are now indelibly linked.
Now, there is only one crossover between I<Warehouse 13> and I<Alphas> with Dr. Vanessa Calder, who recurs on I<Warehouse 13>, appearing on I<Alphas> Q<Never Let Me Go>. This may not be a strong crossover between the two series, but it does create a tie.
2 Holy defenestration, Batman!
On I<A<Batman|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=Batman+(1966)">> many actors have stuck their heads out of a window while Batman and Robin were climbing a wall. In rare cases, a character would stick his head out of a window. These are not crossovers by my definition, though others include them.
When Bill Dana stuck his head out of a window, he was playing himself not his character, Jose Jimenez from I<The Bill Dana Show>.
I<A<The Addams Family|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=The+Addams+Family+(1964)">> was cancelled several months prior to Lurch sticking his head out of a window on I<Batman>.
I<Batman> was set in the 60s, so when I<Hogan's Heroes> Colonel Klink stuck his head out of a window, he was very out of date. I<Hogan's Heroes> was set during World War II.
A crossover did not happen when I<A<The Green Hornet|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=The+Green+Hornet+(1966)">> and Kato stuck their heads out of a window in season two of I<Batman>. Near the end of season two, there was a crossover when I<The Green Hornet> and Kato appeared on the I<Batman> episodes Q<A Piece of the Action> and Q<Batman's Satisfaction>. I<The Green Hornet> is a descendent of I<The Lone Ranger>. They started as radio shows by the same company and then made into television series by the same people, so their crossover works.
2 I'm not home!
Many series have been linked because of the series I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!>. I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!> takes the characters out of their original continuities and places them into another. Since they are outside their original continuity, they are not the same characters. So the following do I<not> cross with each other or anything above.
* Leave it to Beaver and all of its spin-offs and crossovers.
* I<The Donna Reed Show> or I<Dennis The Menace> though they did cross.
* I<A<Get Smart|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=Get+Smart+(1965)">> and its spin-offs.
* I<The Munsters> and its spin-offs
* I<The Cosby Show> and its spin-off I<A Different World>
* I<The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis>
* I<Hazel>
* I<My Mother the Car>
* I<A<Adventures of Superman|href="Movies_by_series.pl?series=Adventures+of+Superman">>

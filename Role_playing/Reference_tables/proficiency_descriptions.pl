__DATA__
The information on this page is from copywritten material owned by TSR.
2 Acting
Acting enables a character to skillfully portray various roles. Acting is most often used as a form of entertainment; it can also be useful in aiding a disguise. If both acting and disguise are known, the proficiency check for either is made with a +1 bonus.
Proficiency checks are required only if the actor must portray a particularly difficult character or is attempting an Q<ad lib> role (i.e., a nonrehearsed role or on short notice).
If a character has both the Acting and Disguise proficiencies, the proficiency check for either is made with a +1 bonus.
2 Adaptation
A character with this skill has a trained mind that quickly analyzes unusual or unfavorable environments and a finely tuned body that can compensate for physical impediments to fighting.
Warriors or rogues who use this skill successfully do not suffer combat and initiative penalties for fighting in an unfavorable environment, most notably the +6 foreign environment penalty to initiative (see Chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook). If the environment also includes special saving throws or ability checks due to physical conditions, such as a Dexterity/Balance check to avoid falling off a ladder when struck in melee, characters successfully using this skill receive a +3 (or +15%) bonus to the check.
The skill does not allow characters to ignore situational movement penalties, environmental factors that are not combat related, or conditions that are physically impossible to overcome. For example, no one can avoid sinking into quicksand without magical aid, and resistance from water still makes slashing and bludgeoning weapons almost useless without a ring of free action or a free action spell. Likewise, characters adapted to fighting underwater still have to find ways to breathe.
The skill has no effect on penalties derived from an environment's magical properties or on penalties based on vision or lighting. In fact, characters who cannot observe their surroundings suffer a –4 penalty to the skill check—it is very hard to size up battlefield in thick fog or pitch darkness.
To use this skill, a character must actually enter combat in a foreign or unfavorable environment. At the end of each round, the character checks the skill. The skill check requires only a moment's thought and can be checked every round until successful. It does not prevent other actions—melee attacks, spellcasting, etc.—during the round. Once the skill succeeds, the character temporarily ignores the environment's special effects, as described above. The effect lasts for the entire battle plus one day per character level thereafter, and this can be extended indefinitely if the character practices fighting in the environment for at least eight hours a week. At an extra cost of one weapon or nonweapon proficiency slot (or three character points), the character can become permanently adjusted to fighting in the environment, provided the additional cost is paid before the adaptation fades.
2 Administration
Many temples own substantial amounts of land and property, wielding power over vast areas. Priests who can manage these lands and turn a tidy profit in the name of the church are always in demand. A character with this proficiency is skilled in the management and accounting of enterprises ranging from the agriculture of an entire province to the vineyards of a single small monastery. He knows how to account for money, plan work, and supervise the collection of taxes or the sale of goods.
2 Adobe
The character is skilled at making a plaster of mud, with which he can build strong walls and overhanging roofs. A skilled character can build a section of wall twenty feet long by five feet high in one day.
2 Agriculture
The character has a knowledge of the basics of farming. This includes planting, harvesting, storing crops, tending animals, butchering, and other typical farming chores.
2 Alchemy
A wizard with this skill is not necessarily an alchemist or a specialist in the school of alchemy, but he is well versed in the physical aspects of magical research and the properties of various chemicals, reagents, and substances. If the character has access to a decent laboratory, he can use his knowledge to identify unknown elements or compounds, create small doses of acids, incendiaries, or pyrotechnical substances, or (if he is 9th level or higher) brew potions.
Refer to the book for information on the size, cost, and equipment of an alchemical laboratory. Naturally, a wizard may be able to defray some of the costs by sharing his facilities or striking some kind of deal with a local wizard's guild; the DM can come up with the details.
Identifying substances or samples of unknown material requires 1 to 4 days and a successful proficiency check. Simple materials, such as powdered metals or ores, provide the alchemist with a +1 to +4 bonus on his check, at the DM's discretion. Rare, complex, or damaged or incomplete samples might impose a –1 to –4 penalty.
Creating dangerous substances such as acids or burning powders takes 1d3 days and 20-50 gp or (1d4+1) x 10 per vial, or 2-5 days and 50-100 gp or (1d6+4) x 10 per flask. The alchemist must pass a proficiency check in order to successfully manufacture the substance; failing the check with a natural roll of 20 results in an explosion or other mishap that exposes the character to the effects of his work and damages the laboratory for 10%–60% or 1d6 x 10% of its construction value.
Acid inflicts 1d3 points of damage per vial, or 2d4 points of damage per flask, and continues to injure the victim the next round; the vial inflicts 1 point of damage in the second round, and the flask causes 1d3 points of damage. In addition, the flask is large enough to splash creatures near the target; see Grenadelike Missiles in the DMG. Acid can also burn out a lock or clasp, forcing an item saving throw.
Incendiaries ignite when exposed to air. A flask of incendiary liquid inflicts damage as per burning oil (2d6 points in the first round and 1d6 in the second.) Again, refer to the DMG. Incendiary powders or liquids can easily start fires if used on buildings, dry brush, or other such surfaces.
Pyrotechnic materials resemble incendiaries, but create clouds of billowing smoke. A vial creates a cloud of smoke 5 feet high by 5 feet wide by 5 feet deep, obscuring vision. A flask creates a cloud of smoke 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet deep. The clouds persist for 1d3 rounds, depending on the wind and other conditions.
Alchemy is an expensive hobby, to say the least, and it can be a dangerous one as well. If a player character is abusing this proficiency (i.e., walking into a dungeon with 10 flasks of acid in his pack), the DM can require item saving throws for all those beakers anytime the character slips, falls, or is struck by an opponent.
Wizards who specialize in the school of alchemy gain a +2 bonus to their proficiency rating in this skill.
2 Alertness
Some characters are unnaturally alert and instinctively note signs of trouble that other characters may miss. A character with this proficiency reduces his chance of being surprised by 1 in 10 if he makes a successful proficiency check. In situations where surprise is automatic, the character may still attempt a proficiency check. If he passes, he is surprised at the normal chance instead of automatically.
2 All-Around Attack
A warrior with this skill is capable of launching a massive blow that can be extended into a whirlwind physical attack that damages every enemy within reach.
An all around attack must be announced in a round's player determination step (see the Player's Handbook, Chapter 9). In the round's resolution step, the warrior makes a single attack roll against any adjacent opponent. If the attack hits, the opponent suffers normal damage from the blow. If the damage is sufficient to kill the opponent, the hail of blows from the warrior automatically inflicts damage on every enemy within a 5 foot radius, as decided by the character. Enemies who are larger than the original target, or whose Armor Classes are better than the original target's, are not harmed. Invisible opponents within the radius can be harmed if their effective Armor Classes (after the –4 bonus for invisibility) is not better than the original target's.
An all around attack is a measure of a warrior's skill and can be made with any type of melee weapon that the warrior is proficient with. However, opponents that would normally be immune to the weapon used cannot be harmed in an all around attack. If the initial attack misses, the all around attack fails. If the initial attack hits, the target suffers normal from the attack. If the damage inflicted fails to kill the original target, there is no radius effect.
|* Warrior Level|Area Damage
|- 10–14|1d8
|- 15–19|2d8
|- 20–24|3d8
|- 25–29|4d8
|- 30+|5d8
The warrior cannot move or take another action during the round when he attempts an all around attack. If the Player’s Option: Combat & Tactics combat system is in use, an all around attack cannot be used as an attack of opportunity or as part of a heroic fray.
Beyond determining if the initial attack succeeds, the warrior’s combat bonuses are not a factor in an all around attack. The damaged inflicted on creatures within the 5 foot radius varies with the warrior’s level as follows:
2 Alms
Some orders of priests rely on the charity of others for their support and livelihood. A character with this proficiency is able to find food, shelter, and clothing in return for the benefit of his wisdom and a blessing or two for his hosts. The quality of the charity the priest finds may vary widely, depending on the wealth of his prospective hosts, their piety and their recognition of his deity, and the way the priest presents himself. Generally, if there’s shelter to be had, the priest can make use of it, but obtaining food or clothing for his companions may require a nonweapon proficiency check at the DM’s discretion.
2 Ambidexterity
Ambidextrous characters are able to use either hand with equal coordination and skill. They are neither right-handed nor left-handed. When fighting in two-weapon style, an ambidextrous character has two “primary” hands, and suffers a –2 penalty to hit with either weapon. If the ambidextrous character spends a slot to specialize in two-weapon fighting style, he suffers no penalty to attacks with either weapon.
This proficiency doesn't give the character two attacks per round. It just means that if he loses the use of one hand, or drops the weapon in that hand, he's equally adept with the other hand.
If the character does try to fight with two hands, he suffers a -1 penalty on the first attack and a -3 on the second roll.
2 Ambush
A character with this proficiency is skilled at laying ambushes and setting up surprise attacks. Most characters can set up an adequate ambush when the terrain favors it and they know the enemy is coming, but a character who spends a slot on this skill is able to create ambushes where ambushes wouldn't normally be possible.
Ambushes are impossible if the attackers have already been spotted by the victims; there's no point in hiding then. If the ambushing party knows their quarry is coming to them, they can lay an ambush. If the attack is going to take place in difficult or unusual circumstances, a proficiency check may be called for; failure indicates that the victims have spotted the ambush before they walk into it. Otherwise, the ambush is guaranteed to achieve surprise.
2 Anatomy
his proficiency involves the knowledge of the secret mysteries and intricacies of the human body, including the structure, function, and location of bones, muscles, organs, and other soft tissues. This skill provides the scholarly foundation for the Anatomist's special abilities. This proficiency also comes in handy with certain necromantic spells (such as corpse link, spectral voice, and graft flesh), which require fresh body parts that have been carefully harvested from cadavers. The wizard can use this skill to repair corpses that have been badly damaged. With a successful proficiency check, the wizard can strengthen and reinforce a body, making it more suitable for animation as a mindless undead. This provides a hit point bonus of +1 per die for skeletal remains, or a bonus of +2 hp per die for a creature to be animated as a zombie.
This proficiency also has some less gruesome benefits. A detailed knowledge of anatomy can help with both the treatment of disease and the accurate artistic representation of the human body. Characters with the anatomy nonweapon proficiency automatically increase their skill with healing and artistic ability proficiencies (+2 bonus to both ability checks).
2 Animal Handling
Proficiency in this area enables a character to exercise a greater-than-normal degree of control over pack animals and beasts of burden. A successful proficiency check indicates that the character has succeeded in calming an excited or agitated animal; in contrast, a character without this proficiency has only a 20% chance of succeeding in the attempt.
<ul>
<li>
Ranger: A ranger's animal empathy ability can produce essentially the same calming effect on an animal as the animal handling proficiency. If a ranger also has the animal handling proficiency, he may attempt to soothe an animal either by making a proficiency check or by using his animal empathy ability--but not both.
If an animal is among a ranger's followers, neither animal empathy nor the animal handling proficiency is necessary to control the follower.
The animal handling proficiency has no effect on a ranger's species enemy.
</li>
<li>
Paladin: A paladin can soothe his bonded mount automatically; the Animal Handling proficiency isn't necessary. The proficiency may be used normally to calm other animals of the same species as the bonded mount, as well as other pack animals and beasts of burden.
</li>
</ul>
2 Animal Lore
This proficiency enables a character to observe the actions or habitat of an animal and interpret what is going on. Actions can show how dangerous the creature is, whether it is hungry, protecting its young, or defending a nearby den. Furthermore, careful observation of signs and behaviors can even indicate the location of a water hole, animal herd, predator, or impending danger, such as a forest fire. The DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A successful check means the character understood the basic actions of the creature. If the check fails by 4 or less, no information is gained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character misinterprets the actions of the animal.
A character may also imitate the calls and cries of animals that he is reasonably familiar with, based on his background. This ability is limited by volume. The roar of a tyrannosaurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a normal character. A successful proficiency check means that only magical means can distinguish the character's call from that of the true animal. The cry is sufficient to fool animals, perhaps frightening them away or luring them closer. A failed check means the sound is incorrect in some slight way. A failed call may still fool some listeners, but creatures very familiar with the cry automatically detect a false call. All other creatures and characters are allowed a Wisdom check to detect the fake.
Finally, animal lore increases the chance of successfully setting snares and traps (for hunting) since the character knows the general habits of the creature hunted.
<ul>
<li>
Paladin: Although this proficiency allows a character to imitate animal sounds, this ability neither helps nor hinders the paladin when summoning his bonded mount.
</li>
<li>
Dwarves: The effectiveness of this proficiency varies according to the background of the dwarf. A dwarf who has lived his entire life underground knows little about animals living above ground, but he will be very knowledgeable about those underground. In this case, a dwarf gains a +1 modifier to his Intelligence when dealing with underground animals, but has no knowledge of surface creatures. A sundered dwarf who fears the underground may only have knowledge of above ground animals.
Dwarves with backgrounds of trade with other races or who live both below and above ground, may have normal animal lore proficiency with no modifiers, knowing both above and below-ground animals.
A character may imitate the calls and cries of animals as described in the Player's Handbook.
</li>
</ul>
2 Animal Noise
A character with this proficiency is capable of imitating noises made by various animals. A successful proficiency check means that only magic can distinguish the noise from that of the actual animal being imitated. A failed die roll means that the sound varies from the correct noise in some slight way.
If the die roll fails, this does not mean that all creatures hearing the noise know that the sound is fake. While creatures and humanoids that are very familiar with the noise know this automatically, other creatures or characters in earshot may require Wisdom checks to determine if they detect the fake.
Bandits and Smugglers often use this ability for communication on the job, almost as a variant dialect of thieves' cant.
2 Animal Rending
This proficiency confers expertise in skinning and butchering animal carcasses. It lets a character derive the maximum amount of food from a carcass (see Table 33 in the Complete Barbarian's Handbook, in the hunting proficiency entry). It also lets him harvest valuable products from the carcass without damaging them. Such products typically include furs, horns, teeth, hides, and organs. (See the appendix, BB Handbook for more about animal products.) Use of this proficiency requires access to the necessary tools.
No proficiency checks are necessary to butcher most animals, but the DM may require checks in unusual situations. For instance, a  check may be required to butcher an animal the character has never seen before, or to successfully harvest a delicate body part (say, the eye of an immature beholder). If the check fails, the character is only able to obtain an average amount of food (the number to the left of the slash on Table 33, BB), or he damages the body part he was attempting to harvest.
2 Animal Training
Characters with this proficiency can train one type of creature (declared when the proficiency is chosen) to obey simple commands and perform tricks. A character can spend additional proficiencies to train other types of creatures or can improve his skill with an already chosen type. Creatures typically trained are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character can choose even more exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence (although these are difficult to control).
A trainer can work with up to three creatures at one time. The trainer may choose to teach general tasks or specific tricks. A general task gives the creature the ability to react to a number of nonspecific commands to do its job. Examples of tasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform heavy labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A specific trick teaches the trained creature to do one specific action. A horse may rear on command, a falcon may pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a specific person, or a rat may run through a particular maze. With enough time, a creature can be trained to do both general tasks and specific tricks.
Training for a general task requires three months of uninterrupted work. Training for a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks. At the end of the training time, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the animal is trained. If the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable. An animal can be trained in 2d4 general tasks or specific tricks, or any combination of the two.
An animal trainer can also try to tame wild animals (preparing them for training later on). Wild animals can be tamed only when they are very young. The taming requires one month of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the end of the month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the beast is suitable for training. If the check fails, the creature retains enough of its wild behavior to make it untrainable. It can be kept, though it must be leashed or caged.
<ul>
<li>
Ranger: Rangers are more efficient than other characters at training animals. In the Standard method a ranger needs two months to train an animal to perform a general task. Training for a specific trick requires 2d4 weeks. At the end of the training period, he makes a proficiency check. If the check is successful, the animal has learned the task or trick. If the check fails, the ranger may make a second attempt at teaching it the same task (requiring another two months) or trick (requiring another 2d4 weeks), followed by a second proficiency check. If this second proficiency check fails, the animal is too dumb or too stubborn to learn that particular trick or task. The ranger may repeat the training process with a different trick or task. An animal can learn a maximum of 2d4 tasks or tricks, in any combination of the two.
The animal training proficiency isn't necessary to train followers.
A species enemy can't be trained by the ranger, neither with the follower guidelines nor the animal training proficiency.
</li>
<li>
Paladin: A paladin doesn't need the Animal Training proficiency to teach tricks and tasks to his bonded mount. However, if he has this proficiency in the same species as the bonded mount, he earns a +2 bonus to his checks when training the bonded mount. The bonus applies to the bonded mount only, not to other animals of the same species. Should the paladin acquire a different bonded mount, he earns the bonus only if he has the Animal Training proficiency in the same species as the new mount.
</li>
</ul>
2 Appraising
This proficiency is highly useful for thieves, as it allows characters to estimate the value and authenticity of antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gemstones, or other crafted items they find (although the DM can exclude those items too exotic or rare to be well known). The character must have the item in hand to examine. A successful proficiency check (rolled by the DM) enables the character to estimate the value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to identify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate a price at all. On a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads the value of the item, always to the detriment of the character.
2 Arcanology
The study of the history and development of magic is termed arcanology. A wizard with expertise in this field is familiar with the works of past wizards. If there was a source of powerful magic in the campaign’s past—for example, Netheril or Myth Drannor in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting—the arcanologist has a good idea of who the great mages were and what they were able to accomplish. Special magical items, spells, or forms of magic wielded by these ancient sorcerers are familiar to the arcanologist. With a successful proficiency check, the arcanologist can identify the general purpose and function of an ancient magical item; the DM may apply a penalty of –1 to –4 if the item comes from a region outside the arcanologist’s normal studies, or is especially rare or obscure. Note that this ability doesn’t help a wizard to identify items manufactured by the “modern” school or tradition of magic, whatever that may be.
2 Armor Optimazation
This proficiency allows a character to use his armor to best advantage against a particular opponent (much like the gladiator special ability). A successful proficiency check in the first round of any combat situation gives a -1 bonus to the character's Armor Class in that situation. A situation is a series of rounds in which a particular character engages in combat. Once the character goes two full rounds without combat, the situation ends. The character must be wearing some type of armor or employing a shield in order to use the armor optimization proficiency. The bonus provided by the armor or shield adds to the bonus from the armor optimization proficiency. Furthermore, the bonus from the armor optimization proficiency adds to that of the gladiator special ability.
2 Armorer
This character can make all of the types of armor listed in the Player's Handbook, given the proper materials and facilities. When making armor, the proficiency check is rolled at the end of the normal construction time.
The time required to make armor is equal to two weeks per level of AC below 10. For example, a shield would require two weeks of work, whereas a suit of full plate armor would require 18 weeks of work.
If the proficiency check indicates failure but is within 4 of the amount needed for success, the armorer has created usable, but flawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 AC worse than usual, although it looks like the armor it was intended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can detect the flaws, and this requires careful and detailed inspection.
If the flawed armor is struck in melee combat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20, it breaks. The character's AC immediately worsens by 4 additional classes (although never above 10), and the broken armor hampers the character's movement. Until the character can remove the broken armor (a process requiring 1d4 rounds), the character moves at ½ of his normal rate and suffers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.
If an armorer is creating a suit of field plate or full plate armor, the character who will use the armor must be present at least once a week during the creation of the armor, since such types of armor require very exact fitting.
This proficiency also allows characters to construct barding for mounts, presuming the availability of materials and facilities. The table below gives the time required to make barding for war horses, and mounts of comparable size. For smaller or larger mounts, the DM should adjust the times accordingly. Elephant barding might require an extra week or two; barding for a small mule might take a week less. Subtract two weeks for all types of half barding.
|! Barding Construction Times
|* Barding Type|AC|Time<br>(weeks)*
|- Leather, Padded|6|Ne
|- Scale, Brigandine, Ring, Studded Leather|5|Th
|- Chain|4|Si
|- Banded, Splint|3|Sp
|- Plate|2|SP
|- Field Plate|1|SM
|- Full Plate|0|SS
As with character armor, barding may be flawed. After creating the barding, the DM secretly makes a proficiency check. If the check fails but is within 4 of a successful result, the character believes the armor is normal, until in combat it functions as 1 AC worse (flawed chain barding has an effective AC of 5). Flawed armor breaks on a natural roll of 19 or 20 in melee combat; the animal's AC then worsens by 4, though it can't be reduced below AC 10 (if flawed leather barding breaks, it has an effective AC of 9). As long as a mount wears broken armor, its movement rate is halved, and it suffers a –4 penalty to its attack rolls. A character can remove broken armor from a mount in 2-8 (2d4) rounds.
Because barding must be fitted exactly, a set of barding styled for one mount won't work for any other animal, even of the same species.
Dwarves are more adept at making armor than other races. Their armorers are the finest in any world and their special skills are carefully hidden from outsiders. They are capable of producing high quality armor very quickly. Instead of 2 weeks per level of AC below 10, a dwarf armorer requires only 12 weeks per point of AC below 10. While a human armorer takes 10 weeks to make a suit of chain mail, a dwarf armorer labors only 7 weeks (5 H 12).The Complete Fighter's Handbook contains extensive rules about the use of the armorer proficiency and is recommended to any character interested in utilizing this proficiency to the fullest.
2 Armorer-Crude
With this proficiency, a character can make crude but effective armor from natural materials like hides, furs, and shells. He can't create armor better than AC 6.
It takes one week per level of AC below 10 to make crude armor (assuming the availability of the necessary materials). A character can make hide armor in four weeks, a shield in one week.
Crude armor tends to be more flawed and less durable than standard armor. After crude armor is created, make a proficiency check. If the check fails by more than 4, the armor is unusable. If a failed check is within 4 of the amount needed for success, the armor is flawed and functions at an AC 2 worse than normal (but never worse than AC 10). Flawed crude hide armor has AC 8; a flawed crude shield offers no protection whatsoever.
If flawed crude armor is struck in melee with a natural die-roll of 19 or 20, it falls apart. The wearer's AC immediately worsens by 4 (to a limit of AC 10). Removing the useless armor takes 1d4 rounds; during that time, the wearer moves at half his normal rate and suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls.
2 Art Expression/Dramatist
No description
2 Artillerist
A character with this proficiency can direct the siting and operation of a bombardment engine. The maximum number of engines the character can control is equal to 1/3 of the character's Charisma/Leadership score, provided that the engines are no farther apart than the character can sprint in a single round.
2 Artistic Ability
Player characters with artistic ability are naturally accomplished in various forms of the arts. They have an inherent understanding of color, form, space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Characters with artistic ability must select one art form (painting, sculpture, composition, etc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can attempt to create art works or musical compositions in their given field. Although it is not necessary to make a proficiency check, one can be made to determine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the check, the artist has created a work with some truly lasting value. If the check fails, the artist has created something aesthetically unpleasing or just plain bad.
Artistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to all proficiency checks requiring artistic skill--music or dance--and to attempts to appraise objects of art.
2 Assimilation
The character with this proficiency is able to study a different culture well enough to pretend to be a member of it. Assimilation allows the character to pick up cultural mannerisms (common rituals, expressions of speech, taboos, etc.). It is distinct from Acting but helpful to that proficiency. A character who has both Acting and Assimilation proficiency receives a +1 bonus to checks with either proficiency when portraying a member of another culture. (This is not cumulative with the Acting/Disguise bonus; if a character has all three proficiencies, she does not receive a +2 bonus.)
2 Astrology
This proficiency gives the character some understanding of the supposed influences of the stars. Knowing the birth date and time of any person, the astrologer can study the stars and celestial events and then prepare a forecast of the future for that person. The astrologer's insight into the future is limited to the next 30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. If a successful proficiency check is made, the astrologer can foresee some general event--a great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship made, etc. The DM decides the exact prediction (based on his intentions for the next few gaming sessions). Note that the prediction does not guarantee the result--it only indicates the potential result. If the proficiency check is failed, no information is gained unless a 20 is rolled, in which case the prediction is wildly inaccurate.
Clearly this proficiency requires preparation and advance knowledge on the part of the DM. Because of this, it is permissible for the DM to avoid the question, although this shouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to make their DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider using this proficiency at the end of a gaming session, giving the DM until the next session to come up with an answer. The DM can use this proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his adventures--something that will prompt the player characters to go to certain places or to try new things.
Characters with the astrology proficiency gain a +1 bonus to all navigation proficiency checks, provided the stars can be seen.
Astrology is only available to dwarves who live on or near the surface of the world. Deep dwarves and others who do not have easy access to the surface do not have the astrology proficiency. In order to use astrology, you have to see the stars.
2 Astronomy
This skill is available to characters from Payit or Far Payit. The character is very familiar with the night sky, and the changes it undergoes during the passage of time. It allows the character to anticipate cosmic events such as eclipses, comets, solstices, equinoxes, the rising and position of the planets and stars.
2 Athletics
No description
2 Awareness
Characters with the awareness proficiency are light sleepers, always alert to danger and attuned to their immediate surroundings. They gain two key advantages:
* If they're roused from slumber (during an attack at night, for example), they can react immediately, as if they had been awake. Provided a weapon is close at hand (a jambiya placed beneath the pillow, for instance), they can even attack during the round in which they awaken. No proficiency check is required. This ability does not affect magical slumber, however, such as that created by a I<sleep> spell or related magicks.
* Characters with the awareness proficiency can detect and ward off the effects of a thief's backstabbing ability. If a thief is backstabbing a target with the awareness ability, and the target is otherwise uninvolved in combat, then the target is granted a proficiency check. If the check fails, the backstabbing occurs normally. IF the check succeeds and the target does not have initiative, the backstabbing proceeds, but the thief suffers a -2 attack penalty (damage bonuses still apply). If the check succeeds and the target has initiative, the target can wheel and attack the backstabbing rogue immediately, causing the rogue to lose all backstabbing bonuses and damage multipliers.
2 Ball Game
No description
2 Bargain
A character with the bargain proficiency can haggle over cash, service, and barter transactions to capture a better deal. In a cash transaction, a successful check allows the character to purchase an item for l0% less or sell one for l0% more than the going rate. In a simple barter transaction, a successful check improves the perceived value of the bargainer's goods by l0%. In protracted barter, a successful check allows the bargainer to roll 3d6 instead of 2d6 for that round of barter; a separate check initiates every round. In a service transaction, a successful check provides the bargainer l0% more than the going rate for his services. The DM should require players to roleplay the bargaining session to gain the benefits of this proficiency.
2 Bartering
This proficiency, which simulates an expertise in trading and appraising, has two applications:
Value Check: With a successful proficiency check, the character can access the approximate value of a common item (a spear, a chicken, a bag of rice). The proficiency only works on items with an actual value of 50 gp or less. It does not work on magical items. A character may make only one attempt per item.
The DM makes the proficiency check in secret.If the check fails, the character receives no special information. If the check succeeds, he has correctly determined the value of the item within 10%. (Tell the player the value of the item, plus or minus 10%, or gives him a range within these values. For instance, if the actual cost of a small canoe is 30 gp and the check succeeds, any of the following responses are appropriate: "about 27 gp,", "somewhere between 2gp and 30gp", "close to 33gp.") On a natural roll of 1, the character has assessed the exact price. On a roll of 20, the assessment is wildly inaccurate (the DM might tell the player that a 30 gp canoe is worth 50 gp, somewhere between 1-5 gp, or nothing at all). Note that value of an object may be different from the asking price; the seller is free to set prices as he sees fit.
Discount Check-This proficiency can also help the character purchase items at bargain prices through intimidation, stubbornness, and sheer force of personality. The character must indicate a particular item (worth 50 gp or less) and make a proficiency check. If the check succeeds, the character may buy the item at up to 20% less than the asking price. The DM determines the discount (between 10-20%): if he prefers, he may determine the discount randomly (roll 1d4 and multiply the result by 5%). If the check fails, the buyer receives no special benefit from the proficiency (he may still purchase the item at the asking price). On a natural roll of 1, the buyer receives a 30-50% discount (DM's discretion). On a roll of 20, the seller becomes offended by the buyer's attitude and refuses to sell anything at all to him.
Only one discount check may be made per item. However, both a value check and a discount check may be made on the same item (the discount check may be made regardless of the outcome of the value check).
Barbarians: Whenever practical, values should be expressed in a medium of exchange used in the barbarian's homeland. If a barbarian commonly trades bobcat furs (worth 2 gp each) and correctly determines the value of a small canoe (worth 30 gp), the DM might tell him the canoe is worth "about 15 bobcat furs" or "between 14 and 16 bobcat furs." If he makes a successful discount check, and the DM decides to give him a 20% discount, the canoe will cost him 12 furs. Fractional values should be resolved in favor of the seller; if the barbarian receives a 30% discount on a 30 gp canoe (for a final price of 21 gp), the canoe will cost him 11 furs (valued at 22 gp).
2 Begging
This proficiency serves two functions. First, it allows the character to pose convincingly as a beggar; success is automatic, so no proficiency check needs to be made. This function is used most by Assassins, Bounty Hunters and Spies in the pursuit of their assignments.
A character can also use begging to procure a very minimal daily income. (Many Cutpurses are in fact beggars who aren't getting enough—and vice versa.) Success requires first that there be people to beg from—people with money to give. A character in an abandoned castle or a recently pillaged village are virtually assured of failure.
The following modifiers are suggested to the DM as guidelines. They do not consider the wealth of a locale, just the population density. Impoverished regions might have greater negative modifiers—but then, so might affluent areas with traditions of stinginess.
|! Suggested Modifiers
|- Same person|-2
|* Locale|Modifier
|- Uninhabited/Wilderness|Automatic Failure
|- Countryside|-7
|- Hamlet, Village|-5
|- Town|-2
|- City|0
If a proficiency check is successful, then a character is able to panhandle enough money, goods or services that day to meet his basic needs (a little food and drink, a place to sleep).
The DM may also use the proficiency check for specific single actions—e.g., a character in disguise as a beggar accosts a specific NPC.
The begging proficiency may not be used to force player characters to give money away; players are always free to decide if and how generous their characters are in response to supplications.
2 Blacksmithing
A character with blacksmithing proficiency is capable of making tools and implements from iron. Use of the proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed fire and bellows, as well as a hammer and anvil. The character cannot make armor or most weapons, but can craft crowbars, grappling hooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, plows, and most other iron objects.
2 Blind-fighting
Blind-fighting is cheaper for dwarves; they only gain the benefit when fighting invisible opponents. Their inherent infravision allows them to fight effectively, even in total darkness.
2 Boat Piloting
This proficiency is useful for negotiating challenging waters with a rowboat, canoe, or small dory. When shooting a rapids, trying to stay afloat in a storm, or trying to row upstream against a strong current, the character will succeed without a proficiency check—unless the water conditions are very extreme. In this case, the DM will require an appropriately modified roll; a successful roll means that the character negotiates the challenge and no further checks are necessary (until the next stretch of rapids, etc.). Failure does not necessarily mean that the boat sinks, but it gets swept away by the current, or turned about, or moderately swamped—with everything and everyone inside getting wet. If the rough water continues, the character must make additional proficiency checks (every 1–6 rounds). The character’s proficiency rating suffers a –1 modifier for each failed check, indicating the difficulty of steering a boat that is slowly filling with water.
The character also knows the basics of sailing, and can effectively maneuver a single masted sailboat. As above, challenges will require proficiency checks, with failed checks leading to increasingly dire straits.
2 Boating
A character with boating proficiency is needed to guide a boat down a rapid stream or to reduce the dangers of capsizing a canoe or kayak. In addition, a character with boating proficiency can insure that a boat is propelled at its maximum speed.
It also allows the character to make minor repairs and improvements in these boats, such as waterproofing them and patching holes. A successful proficiency check enables the character to handle the craft in treacherous situations; for instance, maneuvering the boat though choppy water without capsizing it, or avoiding collisions when guiding it through a narrow channel choked with rocks or ice.
Note that while the navigation and seamanship proficiencies deal with ships in oceans, seas, and other large bodies of water, the boating proficiency is confined to small craft on rivers, lakes, on oceans close to shore, and over similar terrain, usually on relatively calm waters.
2 Boatwright
The boatwright proficiency allows a character to construct all kinds of watercraft up to a maximum length of 60 feet. Larger vessels cannot be built.
The time required to build a boat depends on size. As a general guide, a boat requires one week of construction time per foot of length. Two characters with the boatwright proficiency cut this time by half; three reduce it to one-third. A maximum of one boatwright per 5 feet of length can work on the same vessel.
The basic boat includes hull, masts (if applicable), deck, and benches as required. Features such as a cabin or a sealed hold add about a week apiece to complete. Characters without the boatwright proficiency can aid the boatwright in construction, but two such characters equal the time savings that one additional skilled boatwright could provide.
2 Bookbinding
A wizard with this skill is familiar with the process of assembling a book. Bookbinding is a demanding task; the pages must be glued or sewn to a common backing of some kind, protected by various kinds of varnishes or treatments, and then fastened to a strong and durable cover. Additional chemicals or compounds to ward off mildew and deter moths and bookworms are a necessary precaution.
Bookbinding is especially helpful for a wizard assembling a spell book. Normally, a wizard must pay a bookbinder 50 gp per page for a standard spell book, or 100 gp per page for a traveling spell book—see Chapter 7 of the DMG. A wizard who does this work himself reduces these costs by 50%, although the process takes at least two weeks, plus one day per five pages. If the character passes a proficiency check, his spell book gains a +2 bonus to item saving throws due to the quality and craftsmanship of the work. In addition, the wizard must succeed in a proficiency check if he is dealing with unusual or unsuitable materials, such as metal sheets for pages or dragon scales for a cover.
2 Bowyer/Fletcher
This character can make bows and arrows of the types given in Table 44.
A weaponsmith is required to fashion arrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can perform all other necessary functions. The construction time for a long or short bow is one week, while composite bows require two weeks, and 1d6 arrows can be made in one day.
When the construction time for the weapon is completed, the player makes a proficiency check. If the check is successful, the weapon is of fine quality and will last for many years of normal use without breaking. If the check fails, the weapon is still usable, but has a limited life span: An arrow breaks on the first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on his 1d20 attack roll.
Option: If a character wishes to create a weapon of truly fine quality and the DM allows it, the player can opt to use the following alternative procedure for determining the success of his attempt. When the proficiency check is made, any failure means that the weapon is useless. However, a successful check means that the weapon enables the character to add Strength bonuses to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, if the proficiency check is a natural 1, the range of the bow is increased 10 yards for all range classes or is of such fine work that it is suitable for enchantment.
2 Bowyer/Fletcher-Crude
With this proficiency, a character can make short bows and arrows. To make short bows, the character must be proficient in the use of short bows. To make arrows, he must be proficient in some type of bow.
|! Construction Time for Crude Bows and Arrows
|* Weapon|Construction Time
|- Arrow, flight|7/day
|- Arrow, incendiary|5/day
|- Arrow, poison|5/day
|- Bow, short|12 days
If the character has the hunting proficiency, he receives a + 3 bonus to all crude bowyer/fletcher proficiency checks.
Because crude bows and arrows use natural materials - such as bone, wood, and stone and fine craftsmanship isn't required, construction time is reduced (see Table). Arrowheads must be made by weaponsmiths, but the bowyer/fletcher fashions the bows, shafts, and drawstrings.
As with the standard bowyer/fletcher proficiency, weapons made with the crude bowyer/fletcher proficiency must be checked for quality. A failed proficiency check, made when the weapon is completed, means the arrow shatters on the first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on his 1d20 attack roll.
This proficiency does not allow the option of creating fine quality weapons, including the long bow.
2 Bravery
Warriors with this skill can harness their own strength of will to resist any fear effect.
When subjected to any form of unnatural fear from a spell, creature, or magical item, a warrior can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the fear effect is negated—no saving throw is necessary. If the check fails, the warrior still gets a saving throw if one is normally allowed. Paladins with this skill can use it against turning attempts by evil priests.
This skill is a prerequisite for the captivate, frighten/challenge, and invulnerability skills. Each time one of these skills is used, the character’s base bravery score is reduced by two for the rest of the day. Once the warrior’s base bravery score falls to zero, the character cannot use bravery or any of the other three skills for the rest of the day.
2 Brewing
The character is trained in the art of brewing beers and other strong drink. The character can prepare brewing formulas, select quality ingredients, set up and manage a brewery, control fermentation, and age the finished product.
A paladin whose ethos forbids partaking of strong drink isn't likely to have this proficiency. A paladin with a more liberal ethos may use this proficiency to prepare drinks for others, even if he declines to partake himself.
2 Bureaucracy
This proficiency encompasses a working knowledge of governmental protocol and the skills necessary to navigate bureaucratic organizations. A character with this proficiency knows which official to approach and the best time to approach him (a tax collector's aide may have better access to information than the tax collector himself; a city clerk may be less harried and more helpful at the beginning of the month than at the end). He knows where government records are kept and the procedures for examining them. He knows how to circumvent sluggish or uncooperative bureaucrats. He obtains permits and other government documentation in half the normal time. No proficiency checks are needed for any of these functions.
A successful check shortens the time a character spends in a city dungeon awaiting judgement. It also allows the character to pay 10% less on a tax levied against him; two successful checks in a row allow him to avoid the tax altogether.
A character can also use Bureaucracy to turn the system against someone else. A successful proficiency check doubles the amount of time to make a government decision, causes a permit to be issued under the wrong name, or temporary misplaces an important document.
The Bureaucracy proficiency covers the governmental organizations in a particular region, usually the character's homeland. He may spend additional slots to expand the proficiency to other regions. Official organizations include government councils, regulatory boards, and church hierarchies. The proficiency is only effective when dealing with organizations of 10 or more members.
2 Calligraphy
No description
2 Camouflage
By using this proficiency, the character can attempt to conceal himself, his companions, and inanimate objects by using natural or man-made materials. Successful use assumes the availability of all necessary materials. In forests and jungles, the character can use shrubbery, mud, and other readily available resources. Arctic or similarly barren terrain usually requires special clothing, paints, or other artificial materials (although “digging in” is an old trick which may be applicable in such terrain, depending on local conditions). It takes a character a half-hour to camouflage himself or another person, two or three hours to conceal a cart or inanimate object of comparable size, and a half-day to hide a small building.
Neither human, demihuman, monster, nor animal passersby will be able to see a camouflaged character, presuming the character makes a successful proficiency check. Camouflaged companions will also go unnoticed; only one proficiency check is required for the entire group.
Objects may also be camouflaged. Objects the size of a person require no penalty to the check; cart-sized objects require a -1 penalty, while building-sized objects require a -3 penalty. The DM may adjust penalties based on these guidelines.
Camouflaging has no effect on predators that locate prey by scent or other keen senses; a hungry wolf can still sniff out a camouflaged human. A camouflaged person has no protection against a passerby who accidently brushes against or bumps into him. Likewise, a camouflaged person may reveal himself if he sneezes, cries out from the sting of a bee, or makes any other sound.
Note that camouflaging is only necessary for persons or objects that would otherwise be partially or entirely exposed. A person hiding behind a stone wall wouldn't need to be camouflaged to avoid detection, nor would a buried object.
2 Canoeing
The character can move a canoe with skill and alacrity. A vessel can carry up to one passenger for each skilled character and still maintain its high rate of movement, as long as neither character is encumbered. If he is carrying a load of any kind of cargo, the skilled character must be alone, or penalties apply.
A canoe with too much weight, or too many unskilled characters, only moves half as fast as the normal rate. In addition, the skilled character must make a proficiency check at the start and end of the, failure resulting in the vessel capsizing. Also, checks are required for any unusual maneuvers or mild disturbance in the water's surface.
The character does not have to make skill checks for mild turbulence, in a stream, or waves in a lake or ocean, unless unskilled passengers are carried. However, high surf, raging rapids, or high winds can caused proficiency checks at the DMís option.
2 Canoe-making
The character can build dugout canoes from logs. It requires two weeks to make a canoe that will hold two people, and the character must make a proficiency check to determine success at the conclusion of the process. Failure means a canoe that floats, but is not exceptionally stable or fast.
Larger canoes require approximately one extra week per extra passenger. Canoes capable of holding up to twenty men can be constructed with the use of this skill.
2 Captivate
Warriors with this skill have developed a strong personal presence that is attractive to members of their own races.
Even without a skill roll, children, members of the opposite sex, and other warriors tend to be friendly toward the character provided they are of the same race and their alignments are similar to that of the character. For purposes of this skill, alignments are similar when they share one common element: law, neutrality, chaos, good, or evil.
Friendly nonplayer characters tend to pay attention to the warrior and view what the warrior says or does in a favorable light as long as it is not obviously harmful or contrary to local customs. With a minimum of encouragement, a friendly NPC gives the warrior information, performs simple errands, makes introductions, and so on. The warrior is a celebrity in the friendly character’s eyes.
The warrior can attempt a skill roll to make a suggestion (as the 3rd level wizard spell) to a friendly NPC if the warrior can speak to the person privately for a few minutes. The NPC automatically obeys the suggestion if it does not involve risk, loss, or potential embarrassment; otherwise, a save vs. spell applies. If the warrior gives the NPC an appropriate gift of modest value or does a useful favor, the saving throw is made at a –4 penalty. If the saving throw succeeds, the NPC tries to flee from the warrior’s presence. Each attempt to plant a suggestion reduces the warrior’s base bravery score by two. Once the base bravery score falls to zero, the warrior’s captivate skill is lost for the day.
Creatures with 8 or more Hit Dice/levels are immune to this skill’s effects. Any hostile act or threat by the warrior—including a failed suggestion—breaks this skill’s effects.
If the warrior spends an extended period of time (a few hours or more) in personal contact with a single NPC who is susceptible to this skill, the DM can secretly roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the NPC forms an attachment to the character and acts upon the attachment in some way. More often than not, these attachments prove to  be troublesome to the character. A few suggestions are listed below:
* Stows away in the PC’s baggage.
* Offers to serve the warrior.
* Brags about relationship with hero.
* Undertakes a dangerous task on the PC’s behalf.
* Unfavorably compares a powerful local figure—perhaps a deity—with the character.
* Steals a trinket or minor item from the hero.
* Seeks marriage with (or adoption by) the PC.
* Claims to be the warrior’s spouse or offspring.
* Presents PC with an apparently useless gift.
2 Carpentry
The carpentry proficiency enables the character to do woodworking jobs: building houses, cabinetry, joinery, etc. Tools and materials must be available. The character can build basic items from experience, without the need for plans. Unusual and more complicated items (a catapult, for example) require plans prepared by an engineer. Truly unusual or highly complex items (wooden clockwork mechanisms, for example) require a proficiency check.
2 Cartography
This proficiency grants skill at map making. A character can draw maps to scale, complete with complex land formations, coastal outlines, and other geographic features. The character must be reasonably familiar with the area being mapped.
The DM makes a proficiency check in secret to determine the accuracy of the map. A successful proficiency check means that the map is correct in all significant details. If the roll fails, the map contains a few errors, possibly a significant one. A roll of exactly 20 means the map contains serious errors, making it useless.
2 Caving
|! Penalties
|* Attempt to Detect|Penalty
|- Grade or slope in passage|-1
|- New tunnel or passage construction|-1
|- Unsafe walls, ceilings, and floors|-2
|- Appoximate depth underground|-3
|- Sliding or shifting walls or rooms|-4
|- Stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls|-6
|- Direction underground|-6
The caving proficiency enables a charcter to function underground.  The skill modifier varies depending on the complexity of a character's action.  Note that Dwarves and Gnomes recieve a +3 bonus to their checks.
Because they spend so much time underground, spelunkers are exempt from the standard penalty when attemping to determine direction underground.  They simply use Direction Sense (a required proficiency) in place of the Caving proficiency.
2 Ceremony
A priest with this proficiency is well versed in the various rites, observances, and ceremonies of his temple. He is qualified to oversee normal worship or devotions, but conducting the rites in difficult or unusual situations may require a proficiency check. This proficiency also includes familiarity with ceremonies such as weddings, namings, and funerals, and the priest can perform these services appropriately.
2 Chanting
The character is an accomplished chanter and can use this ability to help fellow workers or soldiers keep pace. Proficiency checks are used to determine the effectiveness of the chanting.
On a successful proficiency check, those who can hear the chanter become slightly hypnotized by the rhythmic sound, causing the time spent on arduous, repetitive tasks to pass quickly. The DM can, at his option, adjust results for forced marching, rowing, digging, and other such tasks accordingly.
2 Chaos Shaping
|! Terrain Maintenance Table
|* Attribute<br>Rating*|Radius of Terrain|Type Of Terrain
|- 0|None|none
|- 1-4|10 feet per attribute point (flat meadow)|simple
|- 5-10|10 yards per attribute point (hills, trees, streams)|omplex
|- 11-18|100 yards per attribute point (buildings, streets)|artifical
|- 19+|1 mile per attribute point (complex buildings)|include native animals
Fortunately for travelers, the elemental nature of Limbo shapes itself to the will of a person's mind.  Most of the time, a person uses his conscious mind to cause bits of solid ground or other terrian to form from the soup of Limbo.  Anyone plunged into the plane's soup can manipulate Limbo's matter to some extent, as detailed on the table.  The problem is, unless a body has the chaos shaping proficiency, it goes away when he sleeps, gets destracted, or just plain forgets.
Use Intelligence for conscious maintenance by ordinary folks; Wisdom for unconsious maintenance by anarchs trained in chaos shaping (see below).
Certain individuals, known as anarchs, have the innate ability to shape chaos.  (The DM should consult Planes of Chaos boxed set for details on how to determine if a character has this ability.)  Untrained anarchs use the table as explained above.  But those designated as anarchs can learn the chaos shaping proficiency, which allows a person's mind to maintain the terrain, even when the character is distracted or unconscious.
The trained anarch uses the powers of the subconscious mind to maintain terrain in Limbo.  With the proficiency, the character uses Wisdom rather than Intelligence on the Terrain Maintenance Table, and is free to preform other action while shaping chaos.
2 Chariotering
A character with proficiency in this skill is able to safely guide a chariot, over any type of terrain that can normally be negotiated, at a rate 1/3 faster than the normal movement rate for a chariot driven by a character without this proficiency. Note that this proficiency does not impart the ability to move a chariot over terrain that it cannot traverse; even the best charioteer in the world cannot take such a vehicle into the mountains.
2 Cheesemaking
This proficiency allows the character who has it to expertly create cheese from the curds of soured milk. A proficiency check is required only when attempting to prepare a truly magnificent wheel of cheese as a special gift or for a special celebration.
2 Chicanery
No description
2 City Familiarity
A character with this proficiency is unusually knowledgeable about one specific community, chosen when the proficiency is purchased. City Familiarity gives the character a good knowledge of the important political and financial figures in the community, an understanding of which families (and criminal organizations) are most important and how they relate to one another and a good grasp of the city's main streets and byways. The character needs no skill check to call on this information. When the character wants more detailed information—such as the precise layout of streets when he's running away from city guards, the name of the number-two man in a specific crime organization, or the knowledge of which politicians are cheapest to bribe—the character must make a proficiency check with a difficulty modifier determined by the DM.
A character can must have lived in a city for at least three months before he can purchase the City Familiarity proficiency and—except for the town in which he grew up—he can do so only with DM permission.
2 Classify Traps
Rogues with this skill have made an exhaustive study of traps and may be able to apply their knowledge to any traps they find. The skill is useless without the find traps ability.
A successful skill roll reveals a trap’s exact nature, not just its general principle. A successful skill roll shows how the trap works and what it does to people who trigger it. The rogue learns where any attacks the trap launches are aimed—provided he can observe those areas. The examination requires at least a turn for basic constructs and possibly much longer for very elaborate traps (DM’s discretion). A magical or invisible trap reduces the rogue’s success number, including ability score bonuses, by half, round fractions up.
A failed skill roll of less than 20 means that the rogue cannot determine anything special about this particular trap. A roll of 20 means the rogue has made a false assumption about what the trap does. As with any roll a rogue makes when finding or removing a trap, the DM should make the skill roll secretly.
If the rogue decides to disarm a trap after a successful examination, the character can make two remove traps rolls taking only the best result. Alternatively, the rogue can simply bypass the trap by standing in a safe place and triggering it, carefully avoiding the areas it targets. If the DM decides it is not possible to completely avoid the trap’s effects, the rogue is allowed a saving throw vs. breath weapon. If successful, the rogue is unharmed; otherwise, the damage inflicted is reduced by half. If the rogue also has the evasion skill, the character gets a +2 bonus to the saving throw. If the rogue has companions, the character can mark or carefully explain what the trap does, allowing these characters to attempt breath weapon saving throws to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim suffers only half damage.
In many cases, a trap’s attack cannot have a half effect. In these cases, the DM can require another saving throw against the trap’s attack form or rule that character’s are fully effected when they fail the breath weapon saving throw.
An example: Jobare analyzes a trap he has found on a door and discovers that opening the door is going to flood the corridor, and possibly chamber beyond, with poisonous gas. Jobare decides that plugging all the gas vents would require too much time, so he advises his colleagues to take deep breaths and tie damp cloths over their faces. When the preparations are complete, Jobare flings open the door. Because the party did not leave the area the gas is flooding into, the DM calls for saving throw checks to see if anyone is effected by the gas. Because it is difficult for someone to suffer a half effect from poison gas, the DM requires the characters who fail their breath weapon saving throws to roll a second saving throw vs. poison to see if they succumb to the gas they inadvertently inhaled. If the trap dropped a 20 ton block into the corridor instead of poison gas, the DM would have been justified in ruling that character who failed their breath weapon saving throws were crushed to death instead.
2 Clockwork Creation
No description
2 Close-quarter Fighting
Humanoids with this proficiency have learned to fight in the cramped confines of dungeons and underground lairs. In such locations, or in other extremely close fighting conditions, characters armed with bludgeoning or piercing weapons (or their own natural weapons) receive a +2 bonus to attack rolls. Slashing weapons cannot be used in closequarter fighting. This bonus is not cumulative with wild-fighting. A successful proficiency check at the start of combat yields this bonus. Failure means the humanoid fights normally.
2 Clothesmaking-Crude
This proficiency enables a character to create simple garments from furs, skins, leaves, and other natural materials. Although crude clothing isn't attractive or stylish, it's generally comfortable and functional. Fur cloaks, grass skirts, and hide loincloths are typical examples. (See Chapter 5, of the Complete Barbarian's Handbook for more about primitive clothing.)
2 Cobbling
The character can fashion and repair shoes, boots, and sandals.
2 Concentration
A character with this talent has rigorously trained himself to ignore distractions of all kinds, deadening his mind to pain or sensation. This allows a wizard to ignore annoyances or disturbances that might otherwise interfere with the casting of a spell. In order to use this ability, the player must state that his character is concentrating when he begins to cast a spell. If the character is struck by an attack that causes 2 or less points of damage, he is permitted to attempt a proficiency check to ignore the distraction and continue to cast his spell (unless, of course, the damage is enough to render him unconscious.) The wizard can try to ignore grappling or restraining attacks that cause no damage but suffers a –4 penalty to his check. Spells that incapacitate without damaging, such as hold person or command, still interrupt the caster if he fails his saving throw.
A character using this ability must focus on the casting of his spell to the exclusion of all other activity, even direct attacks. Any Dexterity adjustment to his Armor Class is lost, and in addition flank or side attacks are treated as rear attacks, with a +2 bonus to hit instead of a +1.
2 Concocting
This proficiency enables the character to concoct chemical with specific uses- such as medicines and poisons.  It also allows the apothecracy to identify various materials-including magical consumables (potions, salves, lotions, and so on).
This identification is nonmagical in nature.  The apothecary can determine only the general nature of the material (for example, this is a posion, this is a healing potion) and not its strength or duration.  The identification process is quite long; it takes the apothecary 1d6 hours to identify nonmagical mixtures and 2d12 hours to identify magical potions and such.
In addition, the materials required for each accurate identification are quite expensive (at least one-tenth of the item's XP value).  This is why most apothecaries charge a great deal of money to identify potions and other mixtures.
If the apothecary rolls a 1 when trying to create something, he manages to create a particular potent brew.  A potent concentration has double it's normal duration.  Alternately, the DM can increase its effectiveness in some other in some other way.  However, increasing a potion's strength by more than half is not recomended.
If an apothecary rolls a 20 when concocting something, he critically fails to create his intended mixture.  Because of the extremely volatile nature of the apothecary's chemicals,a critical concoction failure can be quite dangerous.  When as apothecary makes such a spectacular failure, the DM should roll another 20-sided die and consult the Eureka Table for the results.  Smart apothercaries always identify the results of a failed concoction before tossing it out, as some of the most important concoctions have been discovered by mistake.
|| centered
|! Eureka Table
|* Die Roll|Result
|- 1-2|Magical Discovery: Roll once on the potion tables in the DMG.
|- 3-4|Mundane Discovery: The apothecary creates a known mixture.
|- 5-9|Disappointment: The concoction is useless.
|- 10-13|Holy smokes! A noxious cloud hovers around the apothecary's house for 1d4 days.
|- 14-16|Flashfire: The resultant chemical flash blinds the apothecary for 1d4 days.
|- 17|Chemical burn: The apothecary takes 1d8 points of damage and loses the use of his hand for 1d6 days.
|- 18-19|Minor explosion: The apothecary's lab takes 1,000 gp worth of damage and the apothecary suffers 2d6 points of damage.
|- 20|Major explosion: The apothecary takes 4d6 points of damage and his lab is completely destroyed.
If the apothecary rolls a 20 when identifying a particular material, his result will be significantly inaccurate.  Sometimes this means that he identifies a healing potion as a poison or vise versa, but it could also mean that he identifies a potion of ESP as a potion of red dragon control.  In these cases, the DM should do his absolute best to convince the players that the apothecary correctly identified the material.
To use the concocting nonweapon proficiency, the apothecary must have a well appointed lab at his disposal.  Additionaly, if the apothecary wishes to concoct something, he must have all of the idgredients on hand.
An apothecary must make a proficiency check only when attempting to identify a magical potion or devise a new or particularly complicated concoction (this automatically includes any and all magical concoctions).  Substantially strange or more complicated concoctions may demand a penalty to the proficiency check at the DM's discretion.
2 Contact
This proficiency gives characters access to the psionic attack forms necessary to open a closed mind. Contact allows characters to gain psionic attacks as they become available with level advancement.
Psionicists automatically receive this proficiency. It doesn’t take up any of their available slots. As a psionicist increases in level, he automatically receives psionic attack forms as outlined on the Psionic Progression table. Psionic attack forms don’t fill up a psionicist’s proficiency slots.
Wild talents, on the other hand, must select contact and place it in an available nonweapon proficiency slot if they want to gain its benefits. Once contact is slotted, a wild talent selects one psionic attack. He may select an additional attack by placing it in an available nonweapon slot after he has advanced the appropriate number of levels, according to his group’s progression rate. Wild talents may never have more than three of the five psionic attack forms.
2 Cooking
Although all characters have rudimentary cooking skills, the character with this proficiency is an accomplished cook. A proficiency check is required only when attempting to prepare a truly magnificent meal worthy of a master chef.
2 Craft Instrument
Those who take this proficiency must specify whether they are skilled at crafting wind, stringed, percussion, or keyboard instruments. It takes an additional proficiency slot to gain one of the other skills. Three additional slots allow the character to take the title “master craftsman” as he is able to craft instruments of all forms.
A craftsman must buy materials equal to a quarter of the instrument's sale value. It then takes 1d6 days to craft a wind or percussion instrument, 2d8 days to form a stringed instrument, and 3d10 days to create a keyboard instrument. These times assume that the craftsman is spending 10 hours a day working on the instrument. If craftsman tools (cost 25 gp, weight 5 pounds) are not available, all times are doubled.
The quality of an instrument is determined by a final proficiency check. Failure results in an instrument of poor quality, while success indicates good quality. A natural 20 indicates that the instrument is nonfunctional, while a natural 1 results in a masterpiece worth twice the normal value.
Simple repairs take only 1d4 hours and require no proficiency check unless the proper tools are not available. However, repairing severe damage requires 1d8 hours and a check is mandatory for success.
2 Crowd Working
Characters with this proficiency are familiar with how to handle crowds. Those who take crowd working learn all the tricks of the trade. They are skilled at observing crowds and adjusting their behavior accordingly.
If the character or his group is soliciting money from a crowd, a successful proficiency check indicates that the bard is particularly appealing and the crowd willingly donates twice as much money as it normally would.
(Conditions can improve one category if using the performance rules in the Complete Bard's Handbook.)
2 Crushing Blow*
The character can break hard objects with her hands (or feet if she uses style B). Under ideal conditions, the character can break a wooden board 1/2" thick per level or 1/4" slab of stone or brick per level. Objects that are exceptionally strong, reinforced, supported by other objects (such as bricks in a wall), or not shaped like boards receive a saving throw roll vs. crushing blow to avoid breakage. When used against a creature, the crushing blow does normal damage plus 1 point per level. A crushing blow requires intense concentration. It is a no-move action, and the character can take no other actions during the round when she uses the crushing blow.
2 Cryptography
The character with this proficiency has some training and skill in deciphering hidden messages and codes. In its basic form, the character is allowed to make a proficiency check when confronted with a coded message. If successful, the DM can reveal a general overview of the secret missive.
This proficiency is more fun when used as an aid to role playing. Ideally, the use of the cryptography proficiency requires a great deal of involvement from the player—and a certain amount of puzzle design by the DM—instead of simply passing a check and demanding that a coded message be explained by the DM.
Rather, a character with the cryptography proficiency should have the chance of recognizing a code concealed within a written or spoken message, or perhaps hidden by some other medium—an intricately woven tapestry or sculpted piece of heraldry, for example. The DM will usually roll this check secretly, announcing that the character observes something unusual.
If the character notices the encoded sigil, the DM should describe it in considerable detail—word for word, if it is a written message. The character can make an additional proficiency check during the course of the decoding; if successful, the DM can provide a significant clue—a name, place, or date that is mentioned, for example. The bulk of the decoding should still be performed by the player.
2 Crystal Focus
Many psionicists find that they can achieve a deeper and more productive psionic trance by focusing their medi-tations on an inanimate object. Crystals and gemstones are the most frequently used foci, because of their clarity and durability. A crystal focus gives the psionicist a +1 bonus on power checks for one particular science or devotion.
To use this proficiency, the psionicist must first attune a crystal to one of his psionic powers. This requires a proficiency check and two hours of meditation. After that, he can use the +1 bonus any time he initiates the power if he has the crystal in contact with his body. A psionicist may only attune one crystal at a time. if he rolls a natural 20 on his power check, the crystal burns out and is destroyed.
The crystal doesn’t have to be very valuable—a plain quartz crystal is usually enough to establish focus.
2 Dancing
The character knows many styles and varieties of dance, from folk dances to formal court balls.
2 Danger Sense
This proficiency provides a character with a sixth sense which warns of impending danger. When the character is approximately one round away from triggering the threat (for example, in one round he'll step on a rattlesnake if he keeps moving at his current rate), the DM makes a secret proficiency check. On a successful check, the character the general knows the direction of the threat (in front, to the right, overhead, and so on) and avoids a trap at the last second or realizes that opponents wait to ambush him due to a sudden warning tingle that cannot be ignored. Characters who make successful checks spot traps before blundering into them and receive initiative against hidden opponents. This proficiency does not work against opponents who are out in the open and making no attempt to hide their actions. Failure indicates that the character senses nothing out of the ordinary and play continues normally.
The DM may decide that the character's danger sense does not work against unfamiliar dangers. If an island barbarian has never seen a poisonous snake, he might be oblivious to the rattlesnake's danger. Exotic magical traps or illusions may also circumvent danger sense.
2 Death Blow
This skill allows warriors to strike deadly blows that can fell an opponent in a single stroke.
A death blow must be announced in a round’s player determination step. In the round’s resolution step, the warrior makes a single attack roll against any adjacent opponent. If the attack hits, the opponent suffers normal damage from the blow and must save vs. death magic or be slain immediately. The opponent’s defensive bonuses from protective devices (such as magical armor and rings of protection) always apply to the saving throw. If the DM wishes, the optional saving throw modifiers from Table 36 or from Table 38 can be used as well.
Opponents with more Hit Dice/levels than the warrior are immune to the effect. Creatures that would not normally be vulnerable to damage from the weapon the warrior is using in the attack also are immune.
When a warrior attempts a death blow, that is the only attack a warrior can make during the round. Attacks of opportunity (see Combat & Tactics, Chapter 1) are allowed, however, and a warrior can combine a death blow with an all around attack. Only the initial target of the all around attack is subject to the instant death effect, but this might allow the all around attack to succeed when it otherwise might not.
2 Debate
Characters with the debate proficiency can hold thier own during heated discussions, remaining quick-witted and cool-tempered. They do not gain the ability to convince guards or holy warrriors of their viewpoints, however. Nor can they sway the thinking of unruly hordes or skeptical masses.
This proficiency does allow them to engae in meaningful arguements, impressing others with their mental faculties. As a result, debaters gain a +2 bonus to encounter reactions. (See Table 59 in Chapter 11 of the I<DMG>). When they're attempting to smooth ruffled feathers, the bonus is subtracted from the result on the dice. When they're attempting to enrage another character with the cheek and guile, the bonus is added to the dice roll.
An individual with the debate proficiency is quite engaging. As a result, a character verbally battling one-on-one with such a debater is less watchful of his surroundings. Pickpocket attempts against that character are at +5 percent, the character's initiative is at +3, and the character's ability or proficiency checks are at -3. (The debater does not suffer these penalties unless doing battle with another debater.)
Debaters cannot automatically preoccupy others, however. An individual must be willing to talk in the first place before a debater can use this proficiency. Further, the proficiency doesn't work unless the targeted individual is at least cautious toward to debater (if they saw eye to eye, there would be nothing to debate). Assuming these conditions are met, the debate begins. It continues until the target makes a d20 roll I<higher> than his Intelligence score. (The smarter the individual, the livelier the debate, and the harder it is to end it.) Debate also ends if a sudden action or activity interupts it—for example, a failed pickpocketing attempt, a sudden attack or magical explosion, a scream from the harem, and so forth. As soon as the debate ends, so do the penalties noted above (to initiative, ability and proficiency checks, and the likelihood of being robbed by a pickpocket).
Two individuals with the debate proficiency can seek to best each other in verbal sparring. In this case, both make proficiency checks each round until one fails. Both characters are preoccupied; they suffer the penalties note above while engaging each other in debate.
2 Deep Diving
A character with this proficiency can add 10 feet per round to his speed of descent when diving into the water, or from the surface. Thus, a character with the deep diving proficiency can descend 30 feet per round, plus modifiers for encumbrance, running start, and height. Likewise, a character with the deep diving proficiency can surface at a rate of 30 feet (not 20 feet) per round.
This proficiency provides characters with the ability to hold their breath for 2/3 their Constitution scores in rounds, not the 1/3 allowed to most characters. Effects of exceeding the allotted time are the same, regardless of proficiency ratings.
2 Detect Deception*
A priest with this skill can see through illusions and falsehoods of all sorts.
A successful skill roll allows the priest to uncover any falsehoods the character encounters, be it a false image from an illusion or a false statement from another creature. This skill lasts for a short time, detailed on the table below:
|* Priest Level|Duration
|- 15-17|1 Turn
|- 18-20|2 Turns
|- 21-23|3 Turns
|- 24-26|4 Turns
|- 27-30|5 Turns
If the skill check is unsuccessful, the priest is aware of the failure and must wait one turn to try the skill again. If the skill check succeeds, the priest detects all forms of spoken falsehoods automatically for the duration of the skill’s effect. Unlike a detect lie spell, the priest knows when a creature is deliberately evading the truth. The skill does not tell the priest what the truth is, it only reveals that fact that the priest has heard a lie or evasion. If the priest encounters magic that allows falsehoods to be spoken, the priest is unable to hear the magically protected creature speak; this reveals the falsehood indirectly.
While the skill is in effect, the priest also gains an immediate saving throw vs. spell to see through any false vision or visual distortion created by a spell, magical item, or creature. The DM should make the roll secretly. If successful, the priest sees the false image as a fine, semi transparent mist. This power works against all forms of false and misleading images, including mirror image, blur, shadow door, phantasmal force, and other spells that mislead or visually confuse viewers. Illusion spells that do not create an image, such as invisibility, are not affected. The power also defeats cloaks of displacement, robes of blending, and similar magical items. The skill has no power against effects that disguise things through physical changes, such as polymorph self or shape change.
Each use of this skill, successful or not, lowers the priest’s base eminence score by two for one week. If the priest’s base eminence score falls to zero or less, this skill is ineffective.
2 Detect Signing
This proficiency allows a character to realize when ninja from other clans are communicating using their own clan signs. The character who makes a Detect Signing roll recognizes seemingly meaningless symbols as writing and  ordinary speech as having special meaning, although she just will not know the content of the communication.
At the DM's discretion, a Detect Signing roll made by 2 or more will allow the character to recognize when other sorts of subtle communication are being used, such as thieves' cant.
If a character makes her Detect Signing roll by 6 or better, she can recognize one word or symbol in a specific communication and understand its meaning. The DM chooses which word the character recognizes. (This is an opportunity for the DM to pass an intriguing clue on to the ninja character.)
2 Diagnostics
Both the Healing and Diagnostics proficiencies aid victims of trauma and disease. But while the Healing proficiency can be used to restore lost hit points, Diagnostics is mainly concerned with determining the cause of the damage and the prognosis; Diagnostics alone will not heal damage.
With a successful proficiency check, a character becomes aware all of the following information applicable to a particular patient:
* If the patient has suffered physical damage, the character can determine the extent of the damage, though he may not be able to ascertain the exact cause (if a victim was attacked by a tiger, the character will know that the victim was clawed 	by a large animal, but not necessarily the species). The character can recommend treatments and offer prognoses, as with victims of diseases.
* If the patient has been poisoned, the character knows the antidote (if one exists) and how to prepare it. Note that even if the character knows how to prepare an antidote, he may not have access to the necessary ingredients.
* The character knows the name of the disease, its cause, how long the patient has had it, and the optimum treatment. If the patient is treated as specified, he suffers the mildest form of the disease and its shortest duration. If the patient declines treatment, or the treatment doesn't work, the character can determine the patient's prognosis with reasonable accuracy. (“The patient will recover by the end of the month.” “The patient will become permanently blind if not treated within a year.”) The character may diagnose both natural and magical diseases.
* When examining a corpse, the character can determine how the victim died and approximately how long it's been dead. If the victim died of unnatural causes, the character will only be able to determine the general circumstances of the death. For example, if an evil wizard incinerated the victim with a fireball, a successful diagnostics check might reveal that the victim burned to death very rapidly as a result of some type of magic, but not that it was affected by a fireball.
A character with this proficiency may diagnose himself or any other character, or animals, except for supernatural creatures (such as a ghost or skeleton) and creatures from another plane of existence (like a xorn or aerial servant). He may attempt to diagnose an individual or creature only once.
If a character also has the Healing proficiency, he may modify all Diagnostic checks by +1.
2 Dialects
3 AD&amp;D 2nd Ed. 
A character can speak up to three dialects of any language already known. If there is a sub-dialect, a character needs to have the parent dialect. A character who knows the common language of elves could speak high elven, avariel, and gray elven with this proficiency. This proficiency also adds a +1 bonus to a person’s reading and writing proficiency when it comes to the dialect as long as the character is proficient reading and writing the parent language.
3 D&amp;D 3rd Ed.
A character can speak localized variants of a language.
STRONG<Prerequisites:> Chosen language, Int 13+.
STRONG<Benefit:> A character gains the ability to speak three dialects of any language of your choice as if the character spent skill points to learn those dialects.
STRONG<Normal:> Without this feat, you can only speak the core language and must spend skill points to learn a dialect.
STRONG<Special:> You can gain this feat multiple times.
2 Diplomacy
This is the grand art of high diplomacy between states or organizations. A character skilled in diplomacy knows the correct procedures and unwritten rules of negotiations between states or large organizations. He is capable of discerning the true intent of the various declarations, statements, and gifts or exchanges that make up a diplomatic encounter, and he is able to take his own wishes and couch them in proper diplomatic terms.
Normally, the character need only make proficiency checks if the negotiations are particularly delicate or difficult. However, if there is a specific goal or compromise the character is working towards, he may attempt a check to see if he can win the other side over to his point. Naturally, the DM can apply a modifier of –8 to +8 depending on what the diplomat’s offer means for the parties involved. Requesting the surrender of a vastly superior enemy is next to impossible, unless the character can convince them that they stand to gain something of great value by giving up. In any event, the DM shouldn’t use this ability as a substitute for good role playing by the players.
2 Direction Sense
From the Player's Hanbook:
A character with this proficiency has an innate sense of direction. By concentrating for 1d6 rounds, the character can try to determine the direction the party is headed. If the check fails but is less than 20, the character errs by 90 degrees. If a 20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly opposite the true heading. (The DM rolls the check.)
Furthermore, when traveling in the wilderness, a character with direction sense has the chance of becoming lost reduced by 5%.
From the Complete Book of Dwarves:
Dwarves receive a +2 bonus to their modifier when using their direction sense underground. They may use it above ground, but at a -2 penalty to Wisdom. Sundered dwarves should reverse these modifiers to reflect their fear of the underground.
2 Direction Sense, Planar
Since standard compass sirections as most primes know them don't exist on the planes, this proficiency allows another method of judging direction.  Planar direction sense enables cutters to utilize landmarks and other benchmarks to keep from getting lost.  While a planeswalker may not know which way is north, he does know how to get back to Plague-Mort, the twer of Nirrecles, or the gate to Sigil.
2 Direction Sense, Underground
No description
2 Dirty Fighting
Veteran brawlers and soldiers acquire a repertoire of feints, ruses, and various unsportsmanlike tactics that can come in handy in a fight. A character with this “skill” can attempt to use a dirty trick once per fight; if he succeeds, he gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll. If there's some reason the enemy believes the character will fight honorably (hardly a wise assumption!) the bonus is +2.
Once a particular enemy has fallen prey to the character's dirty trick, he can never be caught off-guard again. In addition, if the character's opponent is skilled in dirty fighting himself, the attempt automatically fails.
2 Disguise
The character with this skill is trained in the art of disguise. He can make himself look like any general type of person of about the same height, age, weight, and race. A successful proficiency check indicates that the disguise is successful, while a failed roll means the attempt was too obvious in some way.
The character can also disguise himself as a member of another race or sex. In this case, a -7 penalty is applied to the proficiency check. The character may also attempt to disguise himself as a specific person, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency check. These modifiers are cumulative, thus, it is extremely difficult for a character to disguise himself as a specific person of another race or sex (a -17 penalty to the check).
2 Display Weapon Prowess
Characters who have this proficiency can put on an impressive display of weapon prowess without fighting at all—swords whooshing in a blur, daggers flashing, arrows splitting melons in two. An individual must use a weapon with which he is already prorficient, but weapon specialist has no further effect. The “show” takes at least a round. Those who are impressed are forced to make a morale check. (Results outlined below.)
Not everyone is swayed by weapon prowess. Characters must pay attention before this proficiency has an impact. For example, this skill might be useful in staring down a guard at the city gate, but would do nothing against a screaming mob or a charging band of desert raiders.
Further, characters who have this proficiency must be of equal or higher level (or Hit Dice) than their audience to impress them. For instance, low-level warrior with flashing blades might awe the equally low-level city guards. But bullying their way through the sultan's elite vanguard would be another matter entirely. Creatures of higher level or Hit Dice than an individual using display weapon prowess are not impressed; they do not make morale checks.
Morale Check Results: Characters who make successful morale checks can see that an individual with this proficiency handles a weapon well; otherwise they're unaffected. Characters who fail their morale checks react in a manner suited to the circumstances at hand.
If the situation isn't desperate, and violence isn't inevitable, characters who fail their checks are likely to try talking to the individual with weapon prowess; else they'll simply back away. They won't surrender outright, but they'll realize that the individual is not the sort to trifle with.
In some instances, walking away and talking things ove rare not viable options. For example, if guards at the sultan's treasury fail their checks, they'll stay at their posts and remain willing to fight. If forced into combat, however, they will suffer a -1 attack penalty.
Player characters are not affected by morale checks. In an individual with this proficiency attempts to awe a PC, the DM should provide a frank evaluation of the display, based on level and success. For example, the DM might say, “She looks darned good with that sword. Your PC I<might> be able to beat her in a fair fight,” or “This son of a dark camel looks like he picked up his swordsmanship watching jesters in the marketplace.” Then it is up to the player to decide how the PC reacts.
2 Distance Sense
This proficiency enables a character to estimate the total distance he's traveled in any given day, part of a day, or a number of consecutive days equal to his level. For instance, a 7th level character can estimate the distance he's traveled in the previous week. The estimate will be 90% accurate.
2 Divine Strength*
Priests with this skill can marshal divine energies to provide a temporary bonus to their Wisdom, Strength, or Charisma scores.
By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the priest can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on the table below. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because the majority of the character’s energy is directed to the improved ability score, the other two ability scores are reduced by two for the same duration. The priest can end the boost and restore the values of the other scores at any time. If the character’s ability score is already higher than the value listed on the table, this skill has no effect. If the optional subabilities rule from Skills & Powers is in play, both subabilities in the increased ability score are raised to the same value.
|* Priest Level|Improved Score
|- 10-14|18
|- 15-19|19
|- 20-24|20
|- 25-29|21
|- 30+|22
The priest can take no other actions during the round the character is concentrating on raising the selected ability score. Each attempt to raise an ability score, successful or not, during a single day lowers the base skill score by two; the skill cannot be used once the base score falls to zero or less.
Bonuses from an increased score are applied immediately when the skill succeeds and are lost immediately when the boost’s duration ends. For example, a priest who chooses to increase Wisdom immediately gains saving throw bonuses against mental attacks but loses them again when the character’s Wisdom score returns to normal. Likewise, the effects from altered ability scores are applied immediately. The priest does not gain any bonus spells from this skill but does gain immunity to certain spells for a Wisdom score of 19 or higher (see Player’s Handbook, Table 5).
A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill operating at any given time.
2 Divine Voice*
Priests with this skill can speak with divine authority.
To use the skill, the priest must speak loudly and clearly for a full round. With a successful skill check (made at the end of the round), the priest’s voice takes on a divine quality. Every creature within 180 feet can hear the priest speaking unless it has been magically deafened. The divine voice penetrates silence spells and up to 10 feet of solid rock or three inches of lead. Antimagic shells, prismatic spheres, cubes of force, and 10th level ward spells shield their occupants.
Creatures that hear the voice are automatically enthralled (as the 2nd level priest spell) if they have less than 5 Hit Dice or levels. Other creatures can save vs. spell to avoid the effect. Creatures do not have to understand the priest’s words, they merely have to hear them. Undead and creatures normally immune to charm spells, such as golems and creatures with Wisdom/Willpower scores of 19 or more, are not affected.
The priest can hold an audience enthralled for up to one hour, as per the enthrall spell, but excessive jeering can break the effects (see the spell description in the Player’s Handbook). The priest can also utter a mass suggestion to creatures the character has enthralled; this functions as the 6th level wizard spell of the same name except that it effects every creature currently enthralled regardless of the priest’s level. There is no saving throw vs. the mass suggestion if it is completed before the enthrall effect ends. The priest can issue only one mass suggestion per use of the divine voice skill.
Each use of this skill reduces the priest’s base eminence score by two for one week. If the priest’s eminence score is zero or less, the divine voice skill is ineffective.
2 Divine Will
Priests with this skill can call upon divine aid to bolster their own strength of will and resist any form of compulsion imposed upon them.
When subjected to any form of unnatural compulsion from a spell, creature, or magical item, a priest can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the effect is negated, and no saving throw is necessary. If the check fails, the priest still gets a saving throw if one is normally allowed.
Divine will is effective against any effect that causes the priest to act according to another creature’s will, including all forms of charm, geas, quest, fear, magic jar (the invading psyche is ejected), beguiling, command, etc.
Each use of this skill, successful or not reduces the priest’s base eminence score by two for one day. This skill is ineffective when the character’s eminence score has been reduced to zero or less.
2 Dowsing
This is the skill of finding lost or hidden items by seeking a disturbance in the subtle natural energies that permeate the earth. A dowser is attuned to the invisible, intangible eddies and currents of the world around him; by careful and methodical searching, he can detect particular emanations or anomalies.
Dowsing has two general uses. First, the character can attempt to detect natural deposits or minerals in the ground, such as water, gold, or other ores. Secondly, the character can attempt to find a specific man made item that has been lost or hidden, such as a friend’s dagger, a buried treasure chest, or the entrance to a barrow mound. The search must be very precise—the dowser will have no luck if he sets out to find ‘the most valuable thing in this field’ or ‘the nearest magical weapon,’ but ‘Aunt Claire’s missing brooch’ or ‘the gold buried by the pirate Raserid’ are suitable searches.
Unlike the spell locate object, the dowser isn’t led or directed to the item he seeks; he has to actually pass within 10 feet of the item, or walk over the place where it is buried, and succeed in a proficiency check to detect the item. (The DM should keep this check hidden from the players so that he doesn’t give away the location with a failed check.) Dowsing can take a long time; quartering the dirt floor of a cellar 20 square feet might take 1d3 turns, while checking a field or courtyard might take 1d3 hours. Searching an area larger than 100 square yards is impractical—the dowser gets tired of concentrating.
A dowser can detect items or substances within 100 feet of the surface, although very strong or powerful sources may be detected slightly deeper. The dowser can guess the approximate depth of what he’s seeking within ±10% when he stumbles across it.
2 Dream Interpretation
No description
2 Drinking
This proficiency, and its companion proficiency, Eating, is important to many humanoids, including centaurs, satyrs, and wemics. A successful check indicates that the humanoid can consume up to twice as much as normal at one sitting. This will allow the humanoid to go twice as long without drink before beginning to suffer adverse effects. If alcoholic beverages are involved, a successful check allows the humanoid to consume twice as much before adverse effects begin to bother him.
2 Dwarf Runes
Dwarf runes are the basic dwarven alphabet and are taught to all young dwarves as a part of their basic education. Depending on the campaign background, runes may have been a gift from the gods, a creation of the dwarves themselves, or an altered form of some other written language. Dwarves will still claim runes to be an intrinsic part of their cultural heritage, and they may take offence if accused of having copied runes!
Dwarven runes are found engraved in stone and only rarely written on such transitory materials as parchment, cloth or paper. They are used to denote ownership, give warnings of nearby dangers and to record history. The tombs of dwarves who have been properly interred, as opposed to hasty burial during battle, are engraved with runes that tell the occupant's clan, his parentage, children, and the deeds of his life. In the absence of proper interment, dwarves erect stone monoliths or engrave entire cavern walls depicting the deeds of their dead. These list the clans, the names of those who died and the nature of their deaths. The numbers of slain enemies are greatly detailed.
Dwarven runes are not a phonetic form of writing, but a conceptual one, with each rune delineating an idea or implying a range of ideas depending on placement. A single rune might convey pages of human or elf writing or be as simple as a sign saying “stairs.” It's a matter of knowing what the rune means and how it is to be interpreted in context. Dwarven runes do not contain conjunctions or pronouns, but proper names are represented by altering an existing rune. This makes runes difficult for other races to understand, and dwarves consider themselves superior to races who cannot read even the most simple of them. All dwarves know them at no cost.
2 Eating
Much like the drinking proficiency, this proficiency allows the humanoid to store up food. A successful check indicates that the humanoid can consume up to twice as much as normal. This allows the humanoid to go twice as long without food without suffering any adverse effects from hunger.
2 Eminence
This skill allows priests to wrap themselves in an aura of divine power.
A successful check creates an aura that lasts one round for each level the caster has attained. The aura is undetectable except by a true seeing spell, which reveals it as a bright silver, inky black, or pearl gray halo depending on the priest’s alignment. The aura gives the priest a +4 encounter reaction bonus when dealing with worshippers of the priest’s deity or creatures of the same alignment.
Any hostile creature feels a shudder of fear when within 30 feet of the priest. If the priest wills it, the fear takes hold, causing creatures of less than 4th level or 4 Hit Dice to flee until the priest is no longer in sight. More powerful creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the fear. The skill works against all types of creatures—even those normally immune to fear attacks, such as undead. A cloak of bravery or remove fear spell breaks the effect, as does a successful use of the warrior skill bravery or the priest skill divine will. Once a creature has resisted the fear effect once, it is not subject to fear effects from the same priest for the rest of the day.
Creatures within 30 feet of an opposing priest using the eminence skill are not subject to the fear effect if the second priest’s level is equal to or higher than the priest using the fear effect.
Each attempt to raise the aura, successful or not, reduces the priest’s base eminence score by two for one week. When the character’s base eminence score is reduced to zero or less, the skill is ineffective.
The eminence skill is a prerequisite for the divine strength, divine voice, divine will, detect deception, and invincibility skills. Each time one of these skills are used, the character’s base eminence score is reduced by two for either one day or one week, depending on the skill used. Once the priest’s base eminence score falls to zero, the character cannot use eminence or any of the other skills. The smite skill is also connected to the priest’s eminence score, but can be used (at some risk to the priest) when the eminence skill has been reduced to zero or less.
2 Enamor
This proficiency allows a ninja to trick an NPC into falling in love with him or her. It is more than the skill of knowing which flowers to send or garments to wear. Enamor proficiency allows the ninja to study his target like a thief studies a vault, looking for weak points to exploit.
Standard use of the Enamor proficiency takes a week of constant contact for a susceptible victim, a month or more for a more difficult target. The DM can allow bonuses to the proficiency roll for a PC who is thorough and clever in his research into the victim's psyche and who takes extra time, and can assign penalties to one who spends too little time or makes wrong assumptions.
At the end of the contact period, the DM rolls the Enamor proficiency for the ninja and compares the results with those listed in the table below.
B<Enamor Proficiency Results>
* STRONG<Ninja Lost by 4+> The victim has been (accidentally) insulted during the romantic pursuit. The victim may attack the ninja, may arrange to have the ninja assaulted, may pretend to be seduced in order to cause the ninja some great harm later, etc.
* STRONG<Ninja Lost by 2-3> The victim is not interested in the ninja and may become irritated with continued pursuit.
* STRONG<Ninja Lost by 1> The victim is flattered but not convinced. The ninja can start over with a –2 penalty to his Enamor check, or can abandon pursuit, perhaps leaving behind some hard feelings.
* STRONG<Even Roll> The victim is flattered but not convinced. The ninja can start over or can abandon pursuit with no hard feelings.
* STRONG<Ninja Won by 1> The victim is flattered but not convinced. The ninja can start over with a +1 bonus to his Enamor check, or can abandon pursuit with no hard feelings.
* STRONG<Ninja Won by 2-3> The victim is infatuated by the ninja but will not change ethics, goals, or loyalties.
* STRONG<Ninja Won by 4-6> The victim is in love with ninja and will help ninja in any way that does not violate important ethics and loyalties.
* STRONG<Ninja Won by 7+> The victim is madly in love with the ninja and will abandon all ethics, goals, and loyalties.
The DM, at his discretion, can additionally make a Wisdom check for the victim. If the victim makes the Wisdom check by more than the ninja made his Enamor proficiency check, the results are as for an Even Roll.
Ironically, the more complete the ninja's success, the more dangerous the situation becomes. A victim who is madly in love may do everything the ninja wishes, including betraying state secrets and turning traitor, but expects the character with Enamor proficiency to be just as much in love. The victim becomes dangerously jealous of potential rivals (seeing anyone remotely suitable as a potential rival) and could become murderous if he realizes he has been duped.
The relationship built by use of the Enamor proficiency need not be a romantic one. Depending on the situation, the relationship might be a friendship or the winning of someone's loyalty away from an enemy.
Although nothing prevents good-aligned characters from learning the Enamor proficiency, the first time they ruin a life with it may be the last time they use it.
2 Endurance
A character with endurance proficiency is able to perform continual strenuous physical activity for twice as long as a normal character before becoming subject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where extreme endurance is required, a successful proficiency check must be made. Note that this proficiency does not enable a character to extend the length of time that he can remain unaffected by a lack of food or water.
A hardy and resilient race, dwarves automatically gain the Endurance proficiency at no cost.
2 Engineering
The character is trained as a builder of both great and small things. Engineers can prepare plans for everything from simple machines (catapults, river locks, grist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, dams). A proficiency check is required only when designing something particularly complicated or unusual. An engineer must still find talented workmen to carry out his plan, but he is trained to supervise and manage their work.
An engineer is also familiar with the principles of siegecraft and can detect flaws in the defenses of a castle or similar construction. He knows how to construct and use siege weapons and machines, such as catapults, rams, and screws.
2 Escape
|! Penalties
|* Binding Type|Penalty<br>(cumulative)
|- Standard rope|0
|- Rawhide, dry|-2
|- Rawhide, soaked and shrunken|-4
|- Wire|-3
|- Fingers individually tied/taped|-4
|* Circumstance|Additional<br>(cumulative)
|- Binding character takes extra time/attention|-2
|- Binding character takes little time/attention|+2
|- Binding character is a thief or ninja|-3
|- Binding character makes find/remove traps roll|-2*
|- Character with this proficiency tries to untie another character|+4
|- Bound character with this proficiency tries to untie another character|-4
This nonweapon proficiency allows a character to slip out of ropes and other types of bindings.
When a character is bound or tied, the DM assigns a penalty based on the type and circumstance of the binding. The table below shows standard penalties for a variety of situations. The character with Escape proficiency can try to use his skill in order to free himself. He rolls his proficiency and applies the appropriate penalties. If the roll is successful, he can untie himself.
The DM may assign a penalty equal to the number by which the binding character makes his find/remove traps roll divided by five. (For example, if the character has a 50% chance but rolls a 30, he has made the roll by 20. The penalty is a -4.)
2 Etiquette
This proficiency gives the character a basic understanding of the proper forms of behavior and address required in many different situations, especially those involving nobility and persons of rank. Thus, the character will know the correct title to use when addressing a duke, the proper steps of ceremony to greet visiting diplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual occurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character to know the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, for example, is a sufficiently rare event).
However, having the character know what is correct and actually do what is correct are two different matters. The encounters must still be role-played by the character. Knowledge of etiquette does not give the character protection from a gaffe or faux pas; many people who know the correct thing still manage to do the exact opposite.
2 Evasion
Rogues with this skill can avoid damage from energy discharges such as breath weapons, fireball spells, and the like through a combination of superior reflexes and inner strength.
This skill operates automatically whenever a rogue is subjected to an energy attack that causes damage. The rogue rolls a normal saving throw vs. the effect and suffers no damage if it is successful. This skill is not effective against effects that do not inflict damage or that do not normally allow a saving throw. For example, the skill does not protect the rogue against a bronze dragon’s repulsion breath weapon, a gorgon’s petrifying breath, or magic missile spells.
The rogue can also avoid missiles fired from fixed points, such as traps and siege engines, but not from creatures. If not surprised, the rogue avoids the missile with a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon.
2 Falcontry
This is most properly the Animal Training (Falcon) proficiency. A character with this proficiency is an expert in training and handling falcons, enabling him to teach them tricks and tasks (This proficiency also allows the training of hawks at a -1 penalty. Owls are a separate proficiency and can be trained at -2).
A character can teach a falcon 2d4 (2-8) tricks or tasks in any combination. It takes 2d6 weeks to teach the falcon a trick, three months for a task. At the end of a training period, the character makes a proficiency check. If the check succeeds, the falcon has learned the trick or task. If the check fails, the falcon is incapable of learning more.
If not using falconry training equipment, the success roll required for training is penalized by -2.
2 Fall/Jump
|* Rogue Lvl|Surface Distance|Distance Fallen
|- 11-13|1'|30'
|- 14-16|2'|60'
|- 17-19|3'|90'
|- 20-21|5'|120'
|- 22-24|7'|150'
|- 25-27|9'|180'
|- 28-30|11'|210'
A rogue with this skill can safely break a fall if there is a vertical surface nearby to help slow the character’s descent. A very accomplished rogue can fall or jump from amazing heights and not suffer the slightest injury.
A successful skill check allows the rogue to make contact with a nearby surface and safely descend. The maximum distance from a vertical surface and the maximum distance for a safe fall depends of the rogue’s level:
Rogues who simply step off a precipice or fall while climbing are always within one foot of a vertical surface unless it has a negative slope (angled back under the place from which the rogue fell). Any surface that can provide a reasonable amount of friction when the rogue grabs it or places his hands or feet against it is sufficient (ropes, tree trunks, walls, etc.). Very smooth or slippery surfaces are useless (ice walls, greased poles, walls of force, etc.).
If the fall is longer than the safe distance allowed for the rogue’s level, subtract the safe distance from the total distance before determining damage from the fall. For example, a trap door opens under Jobare, a 20th level thief, and dumps him into a shaft 10 feet square. No matter what happens, Jobare is within five feet of one wall, so he can attempt to break his fall. His skill roll succeeds, however, the shaft goes down 150 feet and then opens into a chamber 30 feet high and several hundred feet across. Jobare can break only the first 120 feet if his fall and suffers 6d6 points of damage for the final 60 feet. Even if he had been a 30th level thief, Jobare would have suffered 3d6 points of damage because there was no surface within reach to break the final 30 feet of the fall.
2 Fast-talking
|! Fast-Talking Modifiers
|* Target's<br>Int.|Modifier|Target's<br>Wis.|Modifier
|- 3 or less|n/a|3|-5
|- 4-5|-3|4-5|-3
|- 6-8|-1|6-8|-1
|- 9-12|0|9-12|0
|- 13-15|+1|13-15|+1
|- 16-17|+2|16-17|+3
|- 18|+3|18|+5 
|- 19|+5|19+|n/a
|- 20|n/a|-|-
Fast-talk is the art of distraction and conning. If a successful proficiency check is made, the fast-talker is able to get away with whatever scam he is attempting. Modifiers are based on the Intelligence and Wisdom of the target, as shown on the table below. The DM may also introduce modifiers according to the difficulty or plausibility of what the character is attempting.
Modifiers are cumulative. Targets of Intelligence 3 or less are so dim that attempts to fast-talk them fail automatically because they can't follow what's being said. (Creatures that are so stupid are easy to fool in other ways, however.) Targets with Intelligence of 20 or more or Wisdom of 19 or more are impervious to fast-talking.
2 Featherfoot
Rogues with this skill can make their footsteps as light as a feather, moving silently and exerting very little pressure on the surface they are moving over.
This skill is a function of the rogue’s move silently ability, which is a requirement for using this skill. A rogue who makes a successful move silently roll can move a short distance over a surface fairly quickly and without exerting any appreciable weight on it, according to the table below.
|* Rogue Level|Surface|Distance*|Movement
|- 11–13|Soft|30'|12
|- 14–16|Very Soft|60'|15
|- 17+|Liquid|120'|18
The rogue must stop and make contact with the surface after moving this far.
* Soft Surfaces: Mud, snow, sand, or other surfaces where normal humans would leave clear tracks.
* Very Soft Surfaces: Quicksand, fine dust, or other surfaces where normal humans would sink slowly.
* Liquid Surfaces: Water or other surfaces where normal humans would sink immediately.
A rogue using the featherfoot skill moves in complete silence and leaves no tracks on the ground. The character’s weight doe not press down upon the surface at all. The character does not set off any alarm or trap triggered by weight and does not trigger a squeaking floors spell.
2 Feign/Detect Sleep
People who pretend to be sleeping seldom do it right. However, most people don't know how to tell the fakers from those really asleep. Characters with this proficiency are trained to feign sleep accurately and to determine when others are feigning sleep.
This skill is of special use to ninja on guard duty and those infiltrating a secure site. A ninja will use this skill when listening to seemingly sleeping guards and guests. If he detects one who is breathing wrong, he can take steps to capture or silence the faker. Likewise, a ninja can use this skill to convince an intruder that he is truly asleep, so that he can creep up on the intruder from behind when his back is turned.
Acting proficiency can convey the ability to feign sleep, but the Acting check is made at a –4 penalty instead of the standard –1.
2 Fighting Styles
3 Missile or Thrown Weapon
Fighting with missiles or thrown weapons is an excellent option, as long as you can keep your target at a range where you can hit him without being hit. Once an enemy threatens an archer or slinger, it's a good idea to either withdraw or change weapons.
Regardless of a character's size, using a bow, crossbow, sling, blowgun, or firearm at its normal rate of fire requires both hands. Crossbows and firearms can be loaded with both hands and then aimed and fired in one hand, if the attacker's size is equal to the weapon's size or larger. However, heavy crossbows, arquebuses, calivers, and muskets suffer a –2 penalty to the attack roll if aimed one-handed.
3 Single weapon
In single-weapon style, the character wields a one-handed weapon and leaves his off-hand empty. There are some disadvantages to this style, in that the character is shorting himself the protection of a shield or the extra offense of a secondary weapon. However, single-weapon style does leave the character with a hand free for using magical items, grabbing, or punching an opponent.
If the single-weapon character makes an off-hand attack, such as a punch or grab, he's considered to be fighting with two weapons. His primary weapon suffers a –2 penalty to attack rolls and his secondary attacks suffer a –4 penalty to hit. These penalties are offset by the character's reaction adjustment for his Dexterity score.
All player characters, regardless of class, know the single-weapon fighting style.
3 Two weapon
Two weapon style uses a weapon in each hand of the character, a warrior or rogue. The advantage of this is clear: the character either has more attack power or can use the secondary weapon defensively to block incoming blows. Another benefit lies in the fact that even if the character loses a weapon, he's still armed.
The character can use any one-handed weapon in his primary hand, but his secondary weapon must be a size smaller than his primary weapon. Knives and daggers can always be used, regardless of the primary weapon's size. The character suffers a –2 penalty to attacks with the primary weapon, and a –4 to attacks with the secondary weapon. This penalty is offset by the character's reaction adjustment for high Dexterity.
Important Note: While the character receives his normal number of attacks for class, level, and specialization with his primary weapon, he only receives one additional attack with his secondary weapon.
3 Two-handed weapon
The largest and most damaging weapons available to PCs are usually two-handed weapons. Obviously, a character with a two-handed weapon is not going to be able to use a shield or a secondary weapon, but he does have a lot of offensive capability.
Many two-handed weapons are polearms and extended-range weapons that provide the wielder with special tactical benefits in addition to their raw damage potential. Note that a character doesn't have to use both hands just to hold a two-handed weapon; he can hang on to it with one hand to free up the other for another activity, but he can't attack until he gets both hands on the weapon again.
4 Size and two-handed weapons
Generally, a character can use a weapon equal to his own size in one hand, and a weapon one size larger in two hands. For example, a halfling (size S) can use a short sword or hand axe in one hand, since they're size S weapons, but if he used a broadsword (size M) he'd have to use it two-handed, and there's no way he could use a longbow or halberd.
4 One- or Two-handed weapons
Several weapons can be used as one-handed or two-handed weapons. These include the bastard sword, harpoon, javelin, spear, long spear, and trident. These weapons' characteristics change when used two-handed; refer to Chapter Seven.
4 One-handed weapons used Two-handed
Several other weapons are normally one-handed weapons that can be used two-handed if the wielder so desires. There's no particular reason to do this, unless the character's too small to wield the weapon any other way. These weapons include the battleaxe, club, footman's flail, horseman's flail, long sword, footman's mace, horseman's mace, morning star, footman's pick, horseman's pick, and warhammer.
3 Unarmed
Some characters prefer to fight with their fists and feet instead of weapons and shields. Generally, a character can make one wrestling or overbearing attack or two punching attacks per round. If a character is using a weapon in one hand, he can use his second hand for an additional attack, just like fighting in two-weapon style. However, the bare-handed attack creates an attack of opportunity for the defender if he threatens the attacker.
All characters can punch or wrestle; it doesn't even require a weapon proficiency. It's possible to specialize in unarmed combat and become better at hand-to-hand fighting.
3 Weapon & Shield
One of the most common fighting styles in the AD&amp;D game, this style provides the character, either a warrior or priest, with the defensive benefits of a shield and still allows a decent offense. In addition to the AC benefit of the shield, this style also gives the character the attack options of shield-punch and shield-rush.
There are two disadvantages to this style: first, the character is limited to using a single one-handed weapon, since his other hand has the shield; secondly, if he wants to quickly empty a hand, he has to drop his weapon. Most shields are strapped to the character's arm and take a full round to remove.
3 Backward kick
The character can attack an opponent standing in one of her rear squares either by lashing backward or kicking over her own head. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity (but deliberately turning one's back on an opponent does). This maneuver works best for characters proficient in style B, similar to the flying kick described above.
3 Flying kick
The character can leap high into the air, leading with a powerful kick that can strike opponents up to three squares away. The character can land in any square adjacent to the target, as long as it is within two squares of the attacker's starting position. If the character is not proficient in style B, this maneuver is the only attack she can make in the round, and the kick inflicts 2d4 points of damage. Strength bonuses to the attack and damage rolls apply, but specialization and mastery bonuses from another marital arts style do not.
If the character is proficient in style B, this maneuver can replace one kick attack each round, and the kick inflicts 2d6 points of damage. Strength bonuses apply to the attack and damage rolls. If the character is a style B specialist or master, the appropriate bonuses also apply.
If the character has at least one square of running room and declares a half move action, no ability check is required. If the character has no running room or declares a no move action, a Strength/Muscle check is required. If the ability check fails, the attack automatically misses as the character falls down in her landing square.
2 Fine Balance
Characters with this talent are blessed with an innate sense of balance and have an uncanny knack for keeping their feet under them. With a successful proficiency check, the character gains a +2 bonus on any climbing checks, saving throws, or ability checks to avoid slipping or falling. In addition, the character reduces any penalties for fighting in off-balance or awkward situations by 2 points.
The fine balance talent is also very useful for tightrope walking, tumbling, and climbing walls. If the DM determines that a particular feat would be influenced by the character's exceptional balance, the character gains a +2 (on d20 rolls) or +10% (on d100 rolls) bonus to his rolls to resolve the action.
2 Fire-building
A character with fire-building proficiency does not normally need a tinderbox to start a fire. Given some dry wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start a fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not required. Wet wood, high winds, or other adverse conditions increase the time to 3d20, and a successful proficiency check must be rolled to start a fire.
2 Fishing
The character is skilled in the art of fishing, be it with hook and line, net, or spear. Each hour the character spends fishing, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is failed, no fish are caught that hour. Otherwise, a hook and line or a spear will land fish equal to the difference between the die roll and the character's Wisdom score. A net will catch three times this amount.
Of course, no fish can be caught where no fish are found. On the other hand, some areas teem with fish, such as a river or pool during spawning season. The DM may modify the results according to the situation.
A paladin whose ethos demands reverence for life in all forms should refrain from fishing for recreation. However, he may still fish for food.
2 Floating Agriculture
A character with this skill can create land out of shallow lake or marshwater, and use it to grow all sorts of crops. Up to one 100í square (10,000 square feet) can be created by a skilled character during a year.
Such floating gardens are tended with fresh, fertile silt every year, and have an intrinsic and plentiful water supply. Thus, they tend to yield about twice as much as an equal-sized plot on dry land.
2 Flower Arranging
No description
2 Foraging
By using this proficiency, a character can search a wilderness area to locate a small amount of a desired material, such as a branch suitable for carving into a bow, enough kindling to start a fire, a medicinal herb, or a component required for a spell. The character must spend 2-8 (2d4) hours searching, and the material must theoretically be available in the area being searched (for instance an icicle isn't available in the desert, nor dry kindling on the ocean floor). The DM doesn't confirm if the material sought is actually available until after the character has searched for the designated period. If the DM decides the material isn't in the area, no proficiency check is necessary; he merely reveals that the search was in vain.
If the DM decides the material is indeed available, a successful proficiency check means the character has found what he's been looking for. As a rule of thumb, the character locates no more than a handful of the desired material, though the DM may make exceptions (if searching for a few leaves of a particular herb, the character may instead find an entire field).
If the check fails, the material isn't found. The character may search a different area, requiring another 2-8 hours and a new proficiency check.
2 Forgery
This proficiency enables the character to create duplicates of documents and handwriting and to detect such forgeries created by others. To forge a document (military orders, local decrees, etc.) where the handwriting is not specific to a person, the character needs only to have seen a similar document before. To forge a name, an autograph of that person is needed, and a proficiency check with a -2 penalty must be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of his handwriting is needed, with a -3 penalty to the check.
It is important to note that the forger always thinks he has been successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency check in secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until it is too late.
If the check succeeds, the work will pass examination by all except those intimately familiar with that handwriting or by those with the forgery proficiency who examine the document carefully. If the check is failed, the forgery is detectable to anyone familiar with the type of document or handwriting--if he examines the document closely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is immediately detectable to anyone who normally handles such documents without close examination. The forger will not realize this until too late.
Furthermore, those with forgery proficiency may examine a document to learn if it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency roll, the authenticity of any document can be ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a 20 is not rolled, the answer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character reaches the incorrect conclusion.
2 Fortune Telling
This nonweapon proficiency covers knowledge of a variety of methods of divination—all of them fake. The character with Fortune Telling is familiar with numerous devices and methods, such as tarot cards, palm reading, interpreting the flight of sparrows or the arrangement of a sacrificed animal's entrails, and so forth—or at least the character is familiar enough with these practices to make it appear that he's an authentic soothsayer. (If fortune telling can make accurate predictions in the DM's campaign, this proficiency does not necessarily enable the character to do so; it confers no magical powers.) The character makes up the prediction he wishes to tell.
A successful proficiency check indicates that the character's customer or client believes the fortune he was told to be authentic. If the check fails, the sham is discovered in some way, or the prediction is simply not believed. If the DM wishes, the same modifiers described for fast-talking (above) may be used, based on the Intelligence and Wisdom of the subject and the believability of the fortune predicted.
Optional Rule: If a natural 1 (or another number secretly chosen by the Dungeon Master before the die is rolled) comes up, the event that the character predicted actually comes true!
2 Frighten/Challenge*
Warriors with this skill can turn their personal energies outward, producing an aura of fright that forces fairly weak creatures to flee. This skill also allows warriors to issue challenges that draw powerful creatures into personal combat.
To create an aura of fright, the warrior must shout and charge a group of creatures of 4 Hit Dice/levels or less. The creatures must be able to see and hear the warrior to be affected. The warrior makes a skill roll, and, if it succeeds, the creatures scatter, fleeing for as long as the character pursues them. The creatures flee for 1d10 additional rounds after pursuit ends.
Undead and creatures with no morale scores, such as conjured or summoned creatures under the control of a spellcaster, are not affected. Creatures gain a saving throw vs. spell if they are within 30 feet of a friendly creature that is immune to the aura. A cloak of bravery spell negates the effect.
If the skill roll is a 20, the affected creatures attack the warrior instead. If the warrior flees, the creatures pursue as long as they can see him. If the warrior attacks, the creatures automatically pass any morale checks they might be required to make for the next 1d10 rounds.
To issue a challenge, the warrior must be able to speak to the target creature, which must have least 10 Hit Dice or levels. The creature must be close enough to see the warrior (about 100 yards if the light and visibility are good) and be able to understand what the warrior says. The skill check is an opposed roll using the warrior’s Charisma/Leadership score and the target’s Wisdom/Willpower score. If the character wins the opposed roll, the affected creature must immediately advance and engage the warrior in physical combat unless restrained by another creature (restraint breaks the compulsion to attack, but keeps the creatures involved occupied for a full round). Creatures that are unwilling to fight can attempt to save vs. spell each round to break off the fight, otherwise, they engage in melee combat with the warrior. The affected creature can employ spells or missile weapons if it wishes, but it must close to melee range before doing so.
If the target creature has no Wisdom/Willpower score. use Table 10 (page 59) in Dungeon Master's Option: High Level Campaigns to generate one or use the creature’s Intelligence rating. The circumstances surrounding the challenge can alter the opposed die roll as follows:
* –6 to the skill score if the player makes no attempt to role play the challenge. For example, the player says “I challenge the dragon.”
* –4 to the skill score if the player makes only a feeble attempt to role play the challenge. “Why don’t you stop flying around and just fight you stupid dragon?”
* +1 to the opponent’s Wisdom/Willpower score for every companion accompanying the warrior.
* +1 to the opponent’s Wisdom/Willpower score if it has suffered any damage, and an additional +1 for every 10% of its original hit points it has lost.
* +10 to the opponent’s Wisdom/Willpower score if the creature has weak combat powers (THAC0 14 or higher, Armor Class 2 or worse, no physical attack that inflicts more than 6 hit points of damage).
Any roll of 20 is a failure, regardless of the modified score. If both the warrior and the opponent fail their ability checks, the warrior issuing the challenge suffers a loss of confidence and must retreat into cover—or move away from the target at top speed for a full round if no cover is available. The warrior stays away for 1d4 rounds. The bravery skill can be used to avoid this mandatory retreat.
The warrior is free to move and attack normally during the round when the skill roll or ability check is made. Each use of either form of this skill lowers the warrior’s bravery skill by one for the rest of the day (each attempt depletes the warriors inner strength slightly) . This skill cannot be used once the bravery skill falls to zero.
A fighter can use his intimidation gaze while issuing a challenge, but only if the opponent is within range when the challenge is issued.
2 Fungi Recognition
Although they prefer not to, dwarves sometimes have to survive on a diet of fungi. They would rather use these as supplements to their regular diet, but when times are hard, or when involved in an extended underground expedition, it is useful to be able to tell edible fungi from the poisonous or unwholesome varieties. Approximately 50% of underground fungi are poisonous. They may cause an upset stomach or be so poisonous they cause death. It is impossible to harvest edible fungi without the fungi identification proficiency.
If the character has plenty of light and an opportunity to study the fungus in question closely for 10 minutes, no proficiency check is required. If he is unable to see the fungus properly, often the case when using infravision, or has to make a hasty decision about edibility, a proficiency check must be made.
2 Gaming
From the Player's Handbook
The character knows most common games of chance and skill, including cards, dice, bones, draughts, and chess. When playing a game, the character may either play out the actual game (which may take too much time for some) or make a proficiency check, with success indicating victory. If two proficient characters play each other, the one with the highest successful die roll wins. A character with gaming proficiency can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a +1 bonus to his ability score. If the proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, however, the character has been caught cheating (even if he won the game).
A paladin whose ethos includes moral objections to gambling will not engage in games of chance. Using this proficiency to cheat is a serious ethos violation.
2 Gem Cutting
A character with this proficiency can finish the rough gems that are discovered through mining at a rate of 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives no benefit from the assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem cutter must work with a good light source and must have an assortment of chisels, small hammers, and specially hardened blades.
Uncut gems, while still of value, are not nearly as valuable as the finished product. If the cutting is successful (as determined by a proficiency check), the gem cutter increases the value of a given stone to the range appropriate for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant and the value of the gem falls into the range for the next most valuable gem (the DM has the relevant tables).
A dwarf with this proficiency may cut 2d8 gems per day instead of 1d10. He also has a greater chance of increasing the value of a gem. If a dwarf rolls a 1 or a 2 during cutting, he increases the value of the gem to that of the next most valuable class (see page 134 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Any character who fails a gem cutting roll cuts the gem, but does so poorly and reduces its value to the next lower category.
A character who rolls a 20 when cutting a gem splits it in half and ends up with two uncut gems with a combined value one class lower than that of the original gem.
2 Genie Lore
Characters with this proficiency are versed in the nature and background of all geniekind, from the smallest elemental gen to the grandest noble pasha or caliph. The know the proper manner for greeting and conversing with a genie—in other words, the manner least likely to offend the creature. In contrast, other characters must rely on succesful Charisma check both initially and every time the commit a potential I<faux pas> (in the DMs opinion).
Characters who have genie lore also know the heirarchy and organization of geniekind. At a glance, they can tell whether a creature is a marid, djinni, dao, or efreeti. They can also say whether a creature they've conversing with is noble or base.
If a genie is masquerading as a common human, a successful proficiency check reveals the ruse. If this check fails, perception is completely reversed from the truth. In other words, the genie seems definately to be a common person, and a common person seems definately to be a genie. A character with genie lore can perform only one check per “suspect.” The DM rolls this check separately and secretly (not revealing the true results). If an individual with genie lore has no reason to be suspicious, the check is made with half the usual proficiency score, rounded down.
Genie lore also enables a character to detect the work of genies—that is, the physical manifestation of genie spells, as well as items created by a genie's spell like abilities. The chance of success is limited. The character makes the proficiency check using half the usual score, rounded down. If successful, the individual may discern, for example, whether a wall has been constructed by genie-magic, whether a meal was summoned into being by a djinni, or whether a princess is anamored magically by the effects of a dao-granted Wish I<limited wish>.
Genie lore does not enable a character to detect genies moving invisibly through the immediate area. Nor does it help the character see through an extraordinary disguise unless the genie is working some wonder of magic at the time.

2 Giant Kite Flying
This proficiency is of use only to characters who intend to fly the unusual items called hito washi (human eagle) and yami doko (man-sized kite). It is an expensive skill and difficult to master, so there are very few practitioners. Without this proficiency, a character trying to use a giant kite is certain to crash and do himself great harm, if not kill himself. Even with this proficiency, the character is very likely to do so.
2 Glassblowing
A character skilled at this trade can manufacture all kinds of glass containers, jars, or bottles. Creating symmetrical or precise pieces requires a proficiency check, but if a character is making items for usefulness instead of decoration, he can produce about 10 small containers, 5 medium containers, or 2 large ones in a day’s work. The character must have access to a specialized glazier’s workshop and furnace in order to make use of this skill.
2 Gold Casting
The character can carve an object from wax, and then cast it in gold. He builds a clay mold around the wax image, and then pours in the gold, melting the wax which runs out a hole in the bottom of the mold.
2 Grooming
Grooming is the ability to make another look his or her best—with clean skin, well trimmed, and a virtually unmarred complexion. This skill is usually the province of barbers.
Grooming takes about an hour, and after that the partron gains a +2 bonus to encounter reactions when dealing with individuals of his or her own race. The same bonus applies when the patron interacts with geniekind (genies always appreciate a well-groomed supplicant). The effect lasts for two days after the grooming. (Only one reaction roll is required for a given individual during that time, however.)
When combined with the disguise proficiency, grooming enables characters to disguise others just as well as they can disguise themselves. All modifications for disguise still apply, as listed in Table 37 of the Player's Handbook.
2 Haggling

2 Hardiness*
Warriors with this skill can use their inner strength to temporarily delay the harmful effects of special attacks, but not physical damage. If given sufficient time to rest, this skill allows warriors to recover from such attacks without additional aid.
|* Warrior Level|Delay
|- 15–19|5 Rounds
|- 20–24|10 Rounds
|- 25–29|15 Rounds
|- 30|20 Rounds
When subjected to a harmful special effect from a spell, creature, or magical item, a warrior can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the effect is delayed for the period of time shown on the table below. If the check fails, the warrior suffers the effect normally. If the effect allows a saving throw, the warrior rolls the save before checking this skill.
Hardiness does not delay simple damage from any source, including continuing damage, such as Melf’s acid arrow or a sword of wounding, or special forms of purely physical damage, such as severed limbs or broken bones. Nor does this skill protect against effects that are not directly harmful, such as magical charms, entanglement, or imprisonment.
If the skill succeeds, the warrior suffers no harm from the effect until the delay ends, but he is aware of what the effect is. If the warrior receives the appropriate cure before the delay ends, there is no harm to the character. If the harmful effect’s duration is shorter than the delay there also is no effect.
For example, a 17th-level fighter with 34 hit points left (from a total of 115) is battling a wizard who casts power word kill on him. After making his hardiness skill roll, he delays the effects of the spell for five rounds. Two rounds later, after killing the wizard, the party priest casts heal on him. When the delay effect is over, the power word kill effect occurs, but his hit points are now over 60 and he is immune to the spell. If the priest had not healed him, he could have lapsed into unconsciousness in an effort to avoid the effect of the power word, as detailed below.
|* Injury|Recovery Time
|- Minor|1 Day
|- Severe|1 Week
|- Extreme|1 Month
If the harmful effect has not expired or been cured when the delay ends, the warrior must either suffer the full force of the effect or lapse into unconsciousness while the character’s body struggles to resist. The length of time the character remains unconsciousness depends on the extent of the injury, as noted on the table below.
Minor: These effects impair—but do not incapacitate—the character, such as blindness, deafness, and ability score reductions. Spells such as antipathy/sympathy (antipathy effect), cause blindness/deafness, color spray (most of the time), contagion, and holy word are examples of minor effects.
Severe: Includes effects that incapacitate or completely transform the character, such as petrification, polymorphing, and death. Severe spell effects include hold person, phantasmal killer, polymorph other, power word kill, and power word stun.
Extreme: Includes effects that wrench the character’s very being, such as energy drains (per level drained) and magical aging (per year aged). Two notable examples include the 9th-level wizard spell energy drain and the 6th level priest spell age creature from the Tome of Magic.
At the end of the recovery time, the character attempts a system shock roll. If the roll succeeds, the character awakens—fully healed—and the effects of the delayed magic are nullified. If the roll fails, the character awakens, but suffers the full force of the effect. Thus, it is possible for a character to rest for months and then wake up only to die from the effects of the delayed magic.
For instance, if our fighter from the above example had decided to sleep off the effects of the power word kill, he would have been unconscious for a week. The player rolls the character’s system shock roll (17 Constitution) and rolls 98%—1% over what he needed. Since the power word would have killed him at the time he lapsed into unconsciousness, the character awakens just long enough to be killed by the spell.
If a character is suffering from multiple effects, the character makes system shock rolls at the end of each recovery period. The player can choose the order in which the checks are made, but the character does not awaken until checks have been made for all the effects. For example, a character who was drained by a vampire and paralyzed by a lich remains unconscious for nine weeks—one month to revive from each of the two levels the vampire drained and another week for the paralysis.
If an appropriate cure is applied while the character is unconscious, the character recovers immediately and automatically. For instance, the fighter sleeping off the effects of the power word kill spell from the previous example would recover after receiving healing sufficient to raise his hit points above 60.
Heroic Effort: As a last ditch effort to continue a battle, a fighter can use the hardiness skill to extend his life. Instead of dying at zero hit points (or falling unconscious at zero hit points and dying at –10 if the optional Hovering at Death’s Door rule is in play), a warrior who makes a successful hardiness check can continue fighting until reaching –20 hit points. The character can function in this state for a number of rounds equal to his delay effect, suffering the appropriate consequences for reduced hit points at the end of the delay.
Use of this skill is not without its drawbacks, however. If the warrior is reduced to –20 hit points or less, the character is struck unconscious and dies once the delay expires. Once a character’s hit points drop to –20 or less, death is inevitable at the end of the delay period unless unusual conditions exist (see below).
Curative spells can allow a warrior struck unconscious by being reduced –20 hit points or less to rejoin a battle, but death still occurs at the end of the delay period. A raise dead or resurrection spell cast during the delay period prevents death from occurring.
It is possible that a character with the ability to regenerate (from a magical item or high Constitution score) can continue fighting even after being reduced to –20 hit points or less. If regeneration increases the warrior’s hit points to –19 or more during the delay period, the character regains consciousness and does not die if he receives enough healing to restore him to positive hit points before the delay ends. Even if death occurs, regeneration usually restores a character much more quickly than the rest period the hardiness skill requires. A character returned to life through regeneration need not make a system shock roll.
An amulet of life protection also allows a warrior to continue fighting after being reduced to –20 hit points or less if the character receives sufficient healing to restore him to –19 hit points or more. The character still lapses back into death at the end of the delay period, but any form of magical healing can restore him to life (see page 79) and no system shock roll is required.
Each use of the hardiness skill lowers the warrior’s base bravery score by two for the rest of the day. The skill is ineffective if the character’s base bravery score has been reduced to zero or less.
2 Harness Subconscious
Through the use of this proficiency, a psionicist temporarily boosts his PSP total. To procure these extra PSPs, the psionicist’s PSP total must be at its maximum. Two full days (48 consecutive hours) must be spent gathering energy from subconscious reserves. At the end of this time, the psionicist makes a proficiency check. Success increases his PSP total by 20%, rounded up.
The extra PSPs remain available for 72 hours or until they are used up, whichever comes first. At the end of 72 hours, the psionicist loses as many PSPs as he gained from his current total (though the total won’t drop below 0).
During the 72 hours of boosted energy, the psionicist can’t recover PSPs if his current total equals or exceeds his usual maximum. Once all of the bonus PSPs have been used, PSPs can be recovered normally up to the usual maximum.
2 Healing
A character proficient in healing knows how to use natural medicines and basic principles of first aid and doctoring. If the character tends another within one round of wounding (and makes a successful proficiency check), his ministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit points can be restored than were lost in the previous round). Only one healing attempt can be made on a character per day.
If a wounded character remains under the care of someone with healing proficiency, that character can recover lost hit points at the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded character gets complete rest, he can recover 2 hit points per day while under such care. Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can help others recover at the rate of 3 hit points per day of rest. This care does not require a proficiency check, only the regular attention of the proficient character. Up to six patients can be cared for at any time.
A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to aid a poisoned individual, provided the poison entered through a wound. If the poisoned character can be tended to immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and the care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2 bonus to his saving throw (delay his saving throw until the last round of tending). No proficiency check is required, but the poisoned character must be tended to immediately (normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient character) and cannot do anything himself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned character must immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't help). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can attempt the same treatment for poisons the victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his healing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative).
A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to diagnose and treat diseases. When dealing with normal diseases, a successful proficiency check automatically reduces the disease to its mildest form and shortest duration. Those who also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional +2 bonus to this check. A proficient character can also attempt to deal with magical diseases, whether caused by spells or creatures. In this case, a successful proficiency check diagnoses the cause of the disease. However, since the disease is magical in nature, it can be treated only by magical means.
A paladin's ability to heal by laying on hands operates independently of this proficiency. A paladin with the Healing proficiency may use it instead of or in addition to laying hands on a damaged character. For example, a 2nd-level paladin with the healing proficiency could lay on hands to heal 4 points of damage, then use his healing proficiency to heal an additional 1d3 points.
2 Heat Protection
A character with the heat protection proficiency has learned to use clothing and personal pacing to optimize endurance against the rigors of heat. With a successful check, the character need only consume half the normal amount of water per day to avoid dehydration. In combat, the heat protection proficiency allows a character wearing metal armor to battle better and longer. A successful check each round allows the character to avoid the THAC0 loss for that round. In addition, when the character reaches his Constitution score limit to rounds of combat, a successful check will allow him to fight for five more rounds. This check can be made at the end of every subsequent five round period, but once failed, the character collapses from exhaustion.
2 Heraldry
The knowledge of heraldry enables the character to identify the different crests and symbols that denote different persons and groups. Heraldry comes in many forms and is used for many different purposes. It can be used to identify noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political factions, and castes. The symbols may appear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, embroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and more. The symbols used may include geometric patterns, calligraphed lines of script, fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and magical seals (made for the express purpose of identification). Heraldry can vary from the highly formalized rules and regulations of late medieval Europe to the knowledge of different shield patterns and shapes used by African tribesmen.
The character automatically knows the different heraldic symbols of his homeland and whom they are associated with. In addition, if the character makes a successful proficiency check, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of other lands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the inhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon first entering a foreign land.
2 Heraldry, Space
The knowledge of heraldry enables the character to identify the crests and symbols that denote different persons and groups. In space, this is a matter of interpreting the decorations and pennants on ship hulls, knowing the various types of ships and which races use them.
This, on a successful Heraldry (Space) proficiency check, the character could identify the pennant at the mast of a nearby hammership as that of the dread captain Clive the Fearsome of Realmspace.
2 Herbalism
Those with herbalist knowledge can identify plants and fungus and prepare nonmagical potions, poultices, powders, balms, salves, ointments, infusions, and plasters for medical and pseudo-medical purposes. They can also prepare natural plant poisons and purgatives. The DM must decide the exact strength of such poisons based on the poison rules in the DMG. A character with both herbalism and healing proficiencies gains bonuses when using his healing talent (see the Healing proficiency).
A knowledge of herbs, particularly those with poisonous qualities, is of value to Assassins and Bounty Hunters. And Scouts often learn the types and properties of plants in their wilderness journeys.
2 Hiding
|! Hiding Modifiers
|* Opponent's<br>Intelligence|Modifier
|- 3 or less|-5
|- 4-5|-3
|- 6-8|-1
|- 9-12|0
|- 13-15|+1
|- 16-17|+2
|- 18|+3
|- 19|+5
|- 20+|+7
Hiding is the ability to instinctively select the best hiding place under nearly any condition. Characters who make successful checks can virtually disappear from view. Success is determined by modifiers based upon the Intelligence of the character being hidden from. This proficiency operates independently of any natural camouflage or hiding ability the character might already have.
A successful check means he's virtually disappeared from view. The hidden character must remain motionless and silent to prevent discovery.
The concealed character stays hidden unless the creature or character searching for him makes a successful Intelligence check, modified as shown on Table 35 in the Complete Barbarian's Handbook. If more than one character or creature is searching the same area, base the check on the highest Intelligence score in the group.
The DM may prohibit the use of the hiding proficiency in situations where no natural cover is available (a smooth stone plateau, a featureless room). Further, the proficiency has no effect on creatures who detect their prey with senses other than sight.
Barbarians: A barbarian automatically has the hiding proficiency in his homeland terrain. If he spends two slots, he may use this proficiency in all types of terrain.
2 History, Ancient
The character has learned the legends, lore, and history of some ancient time and place. The knowledge must be specific, just as a historian would specialize today in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have ancient periods in mind for his game or can allow the players to name and designate them.) Thus, a player character could know details about the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea-Raiders or whatever else was available.
The knowledge acquired gives the character familiarity with the principal legends, historical events, characters, locations, battles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and magical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of the time. The character must roll a proficiency check to identify places or things he encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows quite a bit about the Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark period of dwarven history. Moving through some deep caverns, he and his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed for untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a successful proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar to those he has seen on “banned” portals from the time of Angnar, doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.
2 History, Future
This proficiency gives the character a general historical knowledge of the specific legends and lore applicable to a future time and place. The time and area must be specified and cover an appropriate span. The correct coverage of a period would be something like studying the rule of Emperor Cassitor and all lands touched by his military program, or studying the general history of the Tegran Empire up to the wars of domination by said Emperor Cassiton
The character has a familiarity with the events, legends, important individuals, customs, locations, crafts, and other such information pertinent to the specified period. A proficiency check is required whenever the character wants to know something specific. If the character is actually in the time in question, a working knowledge of basic social customs and political issues is assumed.
Future history can be learned in any three ways. The first is through the teachings of someone else, like another chronomancer. Traveling to this future land and studying it first hand also grants the required proficiency. And finally, the character might be able to obtain a history book covering this era from further in the locale's future.
2 History, Local
The character is a storehouse of facts about the history of a region the size of a large county or a small province. The character knows when the ruined tower on the hill was built and who built it (and what happened to him), what great heroes and villains fought and fell at the old battlefield, what great treasure is supposed to be kept in a local temple, how the mayor of the next town miraculously grew hair on his balding pate, and more.
The DM will provide information about local sites and events as the character needs to know them. Furthermore, the character can try to retell these events as entertaining stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can either make a proficiency check and, if successful, add that tale to his repertoire, or actually tell the story to other characters. If the character succeeds in entertaining them, the player need not make a proficiency roll for the character, since he has succeeded. The character can tell these stories to entertain others, granting him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the encounter. But telling stories to hostile beings is probably not going to do any good.
2 History, Local, Dwarf
This proficiency is different from the local history proficiency, a character with this proficiency is only knowledgeable about dwarf history. This is chiefly concerned with lineages and events affecting dwarves. It deals with the founders of the clans and strongholds, and traces the descendants to the present. The battles and events of clan and stronghold are known, as well as the fates of those who have left to establish new homes or who perished while adventuring.
The extent of geographical knowledge is dependent on the campaign background. Those who have had no contact with the world above may be totally ignorant of what lies on the surface, but will have extensive knowledge of their own stronghold. Those whose relatives have established new strongholds or are members of such strongholds would have knowledge of the area between the two and some knowledge of the geography surrounding them. Even so, most dwarves, unless they live in close proximity to other races, have a very hazy idea of where the sea is, for example.
While a character with this proficiency knows dwarf history, his knowledge of the history of other races is minimal. If humans fought a great battle against each other, a dwarf who did not live with humans is not likely to have heard of it. If the battle involved dwarves he would probably know of it. If it involved dwarves from his own stronghold or clan, he would have extensive knowledge of the events leading to it and the course of the battle. As with some other dwarf proficiencies the exact extent of an individual's knowledge is determined by his background.
The local dwarf history proficiency may be used to entertain other characters. When so engaged, he gains a +2 bonus to his Charisma while dealing with dwarves. With other races he does not gain the bonus, because dwarf stories tend to be dull, slow moving and overly concerned with who is related to whom, their places of origin, and all of the places the heroes' ancestors founded along the way. Trying to tell a dwarf story to hostile beings is likely to incite them to violence. Orcs will not be impressed, even with the best-told dwarf tale.
2 Hold Breath
This proficiency helps a character hold her breath for extended periods of time. (See the rules in the Player's Handbook, Chapter 14, for the amount of time a character can normally hold her breath.)
With Hold Breath proficiency, a character can hold her breath for half her Constitution score in rounds (rounded up). If the character is exerting herself, this time is halved (again rounding up). When attempting to hold her breath beyond this time, the character rolls the usual Constitution check each round. The first check has no penalty, but each subsequent check takes a cumulative –1 penalty. Once a check is failed, the character must breathe; if she cannot reach air, she dies.
2 Horde Summoning
Though a character may spend the slots to acquire this proficiency at any point in his career, he may only use it when he reaches 10th level. The proficiency enables him to summon a horde of like-minded characters to carry out a specific mission.
The character may only summon a horde in his homeland. Only members from his homeland will join the horde. No evil-aligned members will respond.
To summon a horde, the character must meet the following conditions:
* He must state a clear and specific mission for the horde, such as "Defend our homeland from invasion," "Gather food for our starving neighbors," or "Drive the ogres from the forest."
* He must designate a staging area in his homeland where the horde will gather.
* He must remain in his homeland for a week to spread the word of his intentions.
At the end of the week, he makes a proficiency check. If the check fails, the horde fails to respond. He may spend another week attempting to rally a horde, making a second proficiency check at the end of this period, this time at a -3 penalty. If the check fails a second time, he cannot rally a horde for a period of one month.
If the check succeeds, the horde begins to assemble in the staging area at the rate of 500 men and women per week. The total number of members is equal to the summoner's experience point level divided by 2,000. (If the summoner has 1,500,000 experience points, the horde consists of 750 members; 500 arrive the first week, 250 the second week.) The number of members can't exceed the eligible population of the summoner's homeland.
Approximately 90% of the horde consists of 0-level fighters. The remaining 10% consists of 1st-level fighters. The horde also includes one aide for every 500 members, rounded up; the aides have one-half the level of the summoner (rounded up) and should be the same class as the summoner. Additionally, each aide has two assistants; the assistants have one-half the level of the aides (rounded up) and may be any class of the DM's choice. Finally, the DM may include one wizard or priest per 1,000 members (rounded up); these characters have half the level of the summoner. (Example: A 14th-level warrior with 1,500,00 experience points summons a 750-member horde. The horde consists of 675 0-level fighters, 75 1st-level fighters, two 7th-level aides, four 4th-level assistants, and one 7th-level priest.)
The horde tries to fulfill its mission to the best of their ability. The summoner may not change the mission. If he attempts to do so, the horde immediately disbands and the members return home; the original mission fails. Likewise, if the horde remains inactive for more than two weeks, the members desert; again, the mission is a failure.
Otherwise, the summoner can hold the horde together for a period of weeks equal to his level. Controlling the horde is a full-time job. During this time, the summoner is constantly required to settle disputes, assign duties, and punish the disobedient. Though his aides can handle many of these chores, the ultimate responsibility belongs to the summoner. In any given week that the summoner fails to devote his full attention to his horde, he must make a proficiency check. If the check fails the horde disbands and the mission is a failure.
If the mission hasn't been completed in a number of weeks equal to the summoner's level-and the horde is still intact-the summoner may appeal to the horde to stay together longer. The summoner must make a proficiency check; if the horde is on the verge of success or they've managed to accumulate substantial treasure, the DM may modify the check by as much as + 4. If the proficiency check succeeds, the horde remains intact for another week. If the check fails, the horde disbands and the mission fails. No horde may stay together for more weeks than 150% of the summoner's level, rounded up. (Theoretically, a 13th-level summoner could keep a horde together for 20 weeks. Note, however, that this would require successful proficiency checks for seven weeks in a row.)
If the horde disbands after a successful mission, the summoner will have a better chance of rallying them again; for the next year, he receives a + 2 bonus when summoning a horde. But if the mission fails, his reputation suffers; he must wait a full year before he can attempt to summon another horde.
Barbarians: A barbarian horde consists entirely of barbarian fighters, in the same proportions described above. At the DM's option, the horde may include a shaman (half the level of the summoner) for every 1,000 members, rounded up. The summoner may not order a horde to undertake a mission that requires them to leave their homeland unless he also has the leadership proficiency.
2 Hunting
When in wilderness settings, the character can attempt to stalk and bring down game. A proficiency check must be made with a -1 penalty to the ability score for every nonproficient hunter in the party. If the die roll is successful, the hunter (and those with him) have come within 101 to 200 yards (100+1d100) of an animal. The group can attempt to close the range, but a proficiency check must be made for each 20 yards closed. If the stalking is successful, the hunter automatically surprises the game. The type of animal stalked depends on the nature of the terrain and the whim of the DM.
A paladin whose ethos restricts any type of unnecessary killing will refuse to hunt merely for sport. Unless he has religious or cultural objections to eating meat, he hunts for food. Further, he stalks and kills dangerous animals that pose a threat to himself, his companions, or other innocent people.
2 Hypnosis
With this proficiency, the wizard can hypnotize another character, placing him into a relaxed state in which he is susceptible to suggestions. The subject must be willing and must know he is being hypnotized. Only human, demihuman, and humanoid characters may be hypnotized, and the hypnotist and subject must be able to understand one another’s language.
It takes about five minutes to hypnotize someone in a reasonably calm or peaceful environment. Once hypnotized, the subject is willing to do almost anything that isn’t very dangerous or against his alignment. However, a hypnotized subject can be fooled into thinking he’s doing one thing when he’s actually doing something else. Hypnotism can have the following effects:
* A character can be induced to remember things he has forgotten by reliving a frightening or distant event.
* A character can be made calm and unafraid in the face of a specific situation that he has been prepared for, gaining a +2 bonus to saving throws versus fear effects or morale checks.
* A character can be cured of a bad habit or addiction (but not of curses, physical diseases, or magical afflictions.)
Hypnotism can’t increase a character’s attributes, give him skills he does not normally possess, let him do things that are beyond his capabilities, or give him information he couldn’t possibly know. As a guideline for adjudicating effects, the hypnotism proficiency is substantially weaker than magical commands or directions, such as charm person, command, or hypnotism. Spells magically compel a person to obey the caster’s will; a well phrased hypnotic command is nothing more than a strong suggestion.
2 Iaijutsu

2 Improvised Attack
Rogues with this skill can use unorthodox and unexpected maneuvers to achieve special results in combat. The more unusual the maneuver, the better its chance for success.
A rogue can use this skill only once a day, but the character can learn the skill multiple times. For example, a rogue who learns this skill three times can make three improvised attacks each day. An improvised attack can have one of the following effects:
<ul>
<li>
Blinding: If the attack succeeds, the opponent must save vs. breath weapon or suffer blocked vision (from debris thrown into the eyes, an object wrapped around the victim’s head, or even a hat or helmet dropped over the eyes). The opponent suffers the full penalties for darkness (–4 to attacks, saving throws, and Armor Class and movement reduced to one third; see the Dungeon Master Guide, Chapter 13). Because the opponent’s situation is painful or awkward or both, the blindfighting proficiency does not reduce the penalties. Note that many creatures cannot be blinded in an improvised attack because they have no eyes or visual organs.
The blinding effect lasts until the opponent clears his vision, which requires a roll of 9 or less on 1d20. The opponent’s Wisdom/Willpower or Dexterity/Balance score affects the roll—the DM decides which ability applies. The opponent can attempt to clear his vision at the beginning of each round, but doing so counts as a half move (see the Player’s Handbook, Chapter 9, or Combat & Tactics, Chapter 1).
</li>
<li>
Disarm: If the attack is successful, the opponent must save vs. petrification or lose the use of one weapon (because it is dropped or has become stuck in something). Recovering a lost weapon takes a half move. If the weapon is stuck, the opponent must make a successful open doors roll to get it free.
</li>
<li>
Immobilize: If the attack succeeds, the opponent’s entire body becomes entangled or trapped, and he must save vs. paralyzation or cease all meaningful movement. The opponent remains unable to move or attack until he works free, which requires a roll of 9 or less on 1d20. The creature’s Strength/Muscle or Dexterity/Aim score applies to the roll—the DM decides which ability applies. The opponent can attempt to get free at the beginning of each round, but doing so counts as a half move.
</li>
<li>
Kill: If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers a critical injury that reduces the creature’s hit points to –10 instantly unless the opponent saves vs. death magic. If the save succeeds, there is no effect, but in some cases, the rogue can force the opponent to save again the following round by winning initiative and grappling the opponent.
For example, Jobare has attempted to kill an enemy warrior by slamming a shutter down on his neck. The warrior’s saving throw was successful, but his head is still caught under the shutter. Jobare can attempt a grappling attack to get another chance to strangle the warrior.
Opponents with more Hit Dice or who are higher level than the rogue are immune to kill effects. In this instance, the thief inflicts normal damage.
</li>
<li>
Stun: If the attack is successful, the opponent must save vs. breath weapon or become stunned for 2d4 rounds. The character’s Constitution/Fitness adjustment applies to the saving throw. A stunned character is unable to cast spells, attack, or move at more than half speed. The character suffers a –2 penalty to Armor Class, attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while stunned.
</li>
<li>
Trip: If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers a misstep or other misfortune and must save vs. petrification or fall down. Dexterity/Balance bonuses apply to the saving throw. Creatures that fall while moving at speeds greater than 12 might suffer minor damage (1d3 or 1d6 points of damage, at the DM’s option). In some cases, a fall might be inherently more dangerous, such as when a character falls when climbing or stumbles onto a sharp object. If a fall could result in instant death, use the rules for killing attacks instead. Getting up after a fall counts as a half move.
</li>
</ul>
The improvised attack skill requires some imagination and role playing ability from the player. An improvised attack must be announced in a round’s player declaration phase. During the resolution phase, the player must describe exactly what unusual attack the rogue is employing—a simple called shot never qualifies as an improvised attack. The rogue then makes a normal attack roll. Standard combat modifiers apply, as does the rogue’s backstab bonus for rear attacks that qualify. In most cases, the rogue’s missile bonus from Dexterity/Aim also applies, because most improvised attacks rely on precision and fast movement. Improvised attacks that involve a blow to the opponent are also subject to Strength/Muscle bonuses.
If the attack fails, the improvised attack has no effect. If the attack succeeds, the opponent suffers no damage but must roll a saving throw or suffer the improvised special effect. The cleverness and appropriateness of the attack affects the saving throw as follows:
* +6 if the rogue player made no attempt to role play or describe the attack. For example, the player says, “I blind the dragon with an improvised attack.”
* +4 if the rogue player makes only a feeble attempt to role play or describe the attack. “Uh, I find some dirt and throw it in the dragon’s eyes”
* +2 to +6 if the attack described is physically unlikely to have the desired effect. Trying to trip a horse with a staff is not likely to be effective.
* The save is automatic if the method described is completely inadequate. For example, no character can strangle a great wyrm dragon with a 12 inch leather thong, nor can a character blind a storm giant with a glob of oatmeal unless he can reach the giant’s face.
* +2 if the rogue has used the same trick earlier in the adventure. The bonus is +4 if the rogue has used the trick earlier in the same encounter, +6 if the rogue has used the trick on the same creature during this adventure, and +8 if the rogue has used the trick on the same creature this encounter. However, see the note on establishing tricks, below.
* –2 if the opponent is surprised.
* –4 if the attack described is particularly appropriate. For example, causing a fall from a wall by slamming a window down on the creature’s fingers, entangling an opponent in a fishing net, blinding a creature by tricking it into looking at a dusty object and then blowing the dust into its face, etc.
The optional saving throw modifiers from Table 36 or from Table 38 in the Dungeon Master's Option: High-Level Campaigns can be applied to the saving throw if the DM wishes.
Establishing a Trick: If a rogue has successfully used the same improvised attack in three separate adventures, the character can purchase the improvised attack skill the next time he gains a level and make the trick a permanent part of the character’s skills. An established trick can be used once per encounter without the usual penalty for multiple use; situational penalties still apply. Using an established trick does not count toward the character’s daily allotment of improvised attacks unless the trick is used more than once in a single encounter, in which case the multiple use penalties also apply. Opponents who have fought the rogue previously and are prepared for an established trick gain a +6 saving throw bonus against it.
An Example: Jobare is collecting his ill gotten gains after a game of chance in a seedy inn. When one of the players demands his money back, Jobare asks the fellow to hold out his hand. When the man complies, Jobare grabs his own feathered hat and clamps it over the man’s face. The DM and the player agree that this is a blinding attack. The DM decides that a roll for surprise is in order, as the man is dutifully holding out his hand and not expecting attack. The man rolls a 2 on the surprise die, indicating surprise. Jobare rolls a normal melee attack, adjusts for his Dexterity/Aim score and the fact that the man is surprised. The attack succeeds, and the DM rules that the man must save. vs. breath weapon at –2 or be blinded. His saving throw fails, giving Jobare an opportunity to escape.
Later, Jobare has a special hat made that is lined with pleats of loose cloth that allow the hat to unfold into a small bag, and it contains a springy headband that helps hold the hat in place, whether the hat is on Jobare’s head or on an opponent’s face. Jobare uses his trick hat several times, and when he gains enough experience to advance a level, he decides establish it as a skill (spending one proficiency slot or three character points).
2 Information Gathering
This proficiency represents the ability to gather information from the underworld, most commonly about roguish “jobs” and characters. A character with this proficiency, in appropriate circumstances, will be aware of any major rumors circulating among the lowlife of an area; and with a successful proficiency check, specific information about a person or place can be gathered. (The DM must decide how specific the information is.)
The following modifiers may adjust the proficiency check:
* Characters' reaction adjustments (based on Charisma) should benefit or penalize the roll, assuming contact with people is involved in the search.
* Thieves' guild members receive a bonus of +2, because they are assumed to have more and better-informed contacts than freelancers. Also, their “territory” (below) is considered to be that of the guild, not just their own area of operation.
* Since this proficiency depends on a network of informants and contacts, the thief will be at a disadvantage trying to use it in an area other than his own territory. “Territory” refers to his regular base of operations—a town, one neighborhood of a city, or even a whole province or countryside. Outside this territory the thief does not hear rumors automatically (a normal proficiency roll is required), and gathering specific information suffers a penalty of at least -3. The DM may make it greater in truly foreign areas (e.g., a thief of Waterdeep trying to gather information in Calimshan), due to great differences in language, culture or race.
Finally, any time a proficiency check is required for information gathering, a small investment of money for drinks, bribes, and so forth must be made, or an additional penalty of -3 is imposed. A total of 1d10 gp is typical, and it is lost whether or not the desired information is found. (If the information is still unknown, the character can continue his search the next day, spending more money and making another proficiency check.) The DM is free to increase the cost of using this proficiency if it suits the campaign.
It's best to role-play information searches whenever possible.
2 Inner Focus
Warriors or rogues with this skill can marshal their personal energies to provide a temporary bonus to their Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution scores.
By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the warrior can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on the table below. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because the majority of the character’s energy is directed to the improved ability score, the other two ability scores are reduced by two for the same duration. Reductions lower scores by two full points; an extraordinary Strength score (18/01–18/00) is reduced to 16. The warrior can end the boost—and restore the values of the other scores—at any time. If the character’s ability score is already higher than the value listed on the table, this skill has no effect. If the optional subabilities rule from Skills & Powers is in play, both subabilities in the increased ability score are raised to the same value.
|* Warrior Level|Improved Score
|- 10–14|18 (18/00)
|- 15–19|19
|- 20–24|20
|- 25–29|21
|- 30+|22
|* Rogue Level|Improved Score
|- 11–15|18
|- 16–20|19
|- 21–25|20
|- 26–30|21
The warrior or rogue can take no other actions during the round spent concentrating on raising the selected ability score. Each attempt, successful or not, during a single day lowers the base skill score by two. The skill cannot be used once the base score falls to zero or less.
Bonuses are applied immediately when the skill succeeds and are lost immediately when the boost’s duration ends. For example, a warrior who chooses to increase Constitution immediately gains bonus hit points but loses them again when the character’s Constitution score returns to normal. Likewise, the effects from reduced ability scores are applied immediately but then restored when the improvement ends.
A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill operating at any given time.
2 Instant Stand*
The character can instantly regain his feet after falling down. If the ability check succeeds, the character can ignore the effects of knockdowns or failed spring attempts. If the ability check fails, the character can get up during his next action phase, but cannot take any further actions until the next round. Characters cannot use this skill while pinned, locked, held, or grappled.
2 Intimidation
This proficiency allows a character to intimidate others to do as he wishes. It involves an implicit threat of violence. Threatened NPCs will do as they are told, but will harbor resentments against him. If an opportunity arises for intimidated NPCs to revenge themselves they will do so.
Intimidation may be attempted with one of two abilities, Strength or Charisma. If intimidating by Strength, the character is threatening immediate, personal, bodily harm. If by Charisma, the intimidation consists of subtle threats, which need not be physical. No matter which ability is used, the intimidation attempt is always modified by the difference between the experience level of the intimidating character and the experience level or Hit Dice of the victim(s). Creatures with less than one Hit Die are considered to have a level of 0.
A 6th-level warrior attempting to intimidate an HD1-1 goblin would gain a +6 bonus to his intimidation ability. Against a 10th-level human warrior, our 6th-level dwarf's intimidation proficiency would be reduced by -4. Higher level characters are less likely to be intimidated.
When a character is attempting to intimidate more than one character, and all are within 1-4 experience levels of each other, the level is the average of them. If one or more characters are over five experience levels above the others, the highest experience level is used, the other characters gaining confidence from the presence of a powerful individual.
When attempting to intimidate more than one, the number of characters is used as a negative modifier. If a dwarf is attempting to intimidate five goblins, his intimidate proficiency is reduced by -5.
Intimidation may only be used against intelligent creatures; slimes and shambling mounds are too stupid to notice that someone is trying to intimidate them.
Player characters are never forced to submit to intimidation, and may choose how they are going to react to an attempt.
2 Investigation
This is the art of discovering the truth through careful examination of a problem or situation. A character with this skill is familiar with the process of interviewing or interrogating witnesses, searching scenes for clues or information, and the general execution of a logical and thorough investigation. Priests who are associated with the local government may be called upon to solve common crimes against the state, while other priests may be inquisitors or theological investigators.
The DM may allow the PC to attempt a proficiency check when the player is missing an obvious line of inquiry or step of deductive reasoning, although this should be a rare use of this ability. An investigation proficiency check can also be used to discover clues at the scene of a crime or to extract information from a witness or suspect.
2 Invincibility*
Priests with this skill can draw upon divine power to temporarily delay the harmful effects of special attacks, but not physical damage. If given sufficient time to rest, this skill allows priests to recover from such attacks without additional aid. It is very similar to the warrior skill hardiness.
|* Priest Level|Delay
|- 21–23|5 Rounds
|- 24–26|10 Rounds
|- 27–30|15 Rounds
When subjected to a harmful special effect from a spell, creature, or magical item, a priest can roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the effect is delayed for the period of time shown on the table below. If the check fails, the priest suffers the effect normally. If the effect allows a saving throw, the priest rolls the save before checking this skill.
Invincibility does not delay simple damage from any source, including continuing damage, such as Melf’s acid arrow or a sword of wounding, or special forms of purely physical damage, such as severed limbs or broken bones. This skill does not protect against effects that are not directly harmful, such as magical charms, entanglement, or imprisonment.
If the skill succeeds, the priest suffers no harm from the delayed effect until the delay ends, but he is aware of what the effect is. If the priest receives the appropriate cure before the delay ends, there is no harm to the character. If the harmful effect’s duration is shorter than the delay there also is no effect.
For example, a 25th level priest with 52 hit points left (from a total of 107) is battling a wizard who casts power word kill on him. After making his invincibility skill roll, he delays the effects of the spell for 10 rounds. Four rounds later, after killing the wizard, he casts heal on himself. When the delay effect is over, the power word kill effect occurs, but his hit points are now over 60 and he is immune to the spell. If he had not healed himself, he could have lapsed into unconsciousness in an effort to avoid the effect of the power word, as detailed below.
|* Injury|Recovery Time
|- Minor|1 Day
|- Severe|1 Week
|- Extreme|1 Month
If the harmful effect has not expired or been cured when the delay ends, the priest must either suffer the full force of the effect or lapse into unconsciousness while the character’s body struggles to resist. The length of time the character remains unconsciousness depends on the extent of the injury, as noted on the table at the right.
* Minor: These effects impair—but do not incapacitate—the character, such as blindness, deafness, and ability score reductions. Spells such as antipathy/sympathy (antipathy effect), cause blindness/deafness, color spray (most of the time), contagion, and holy word are examples of minor effects.
* Severe: Includes effects that incapacitate or completely transform the character, such as petrification, polymorphing, and death. Severe spell effects include hold person, phantasmal killer, polymorph other, power word kill, and power word stun.
* Extreme: Includes effects that wrench the character’s very being, such as energy drains (per level drained) and magical aging (per year aged). Two notable examples include the 9th level wizard spell energy drain and the 6th level priest spell age creature from the Tome of Magic.
At the end of the recovery time, the character attempts a system shock roll. If the roll succeeds, the character awakens—fully healed—and the effects of the delayed magic are nullified. If the roll fails, the character awakens, but suffers the full force of the effect. Thus, it is possible for a character to rest for months and then wake up only to die from the effects of the delayed magic.
For instance, if our priest from the above example had decided to sleep off the effects of the power word kill, he would have been unconscious for a week. The player rolls the character’s system shock roll (15 Constitution) and rolls 96%—6% over what he needed. Since the power word would have killed him at the time he lapsed into unconsciousness, the character awakens just long enough to be killed by the spell.
If a character is suffering from multiple effects, the character makes system shock rolls at the end of each recovery period. The player can choose the order in which the checks are made, but the character does not awaken until checks have been made for all the effects. For example, a character who was drained by a vampire and paralyzed by a lich remains unconscious for nine weeks—one month to revive from each of the two levels the vampire drained and another week for the paralysis.
If an appropriate cure is applied while the character is unconscious, the character recovers immediately and automatically.
Heroic Effort: As a last ditch effort to continue a battle, a priest can use the invincibility skill to extend his life. Instead of dying at zero hit points (or falling unconscious at zero hit points and dying at –10 if the optional Hovering at Death’s Door rule is in play), a priest who makes a successful invincibility check can continue fighting until reaching –20 hit points. The character can function in this state for a number of rounds equal to his delay effect, suffering the appropriate consequences for reduced hit points at the end of the delay.
Use of this skill is not without its drawbacks, however. If the priest is reduced to –20 hit points or less, the character is struck unconscious and dies once the delay expires. Once a character’s hit points drop to –20 or less, death is inevitable at the end of the delay period unless unusual conditions exist (see below).
Curative spells can allow a priest struck unconscious by being reduced –20 hit points or less to rejoin a battle, but death still occurs at the end of the delay period. A raise dead or resurrection spell cast during the delay period prevents death from occurring.
It is possible that a character with the ability to regenerate (from a magical item or high Constitution score) can continue fighting even after being reduced to –20 hit points or less. If regeneration increases the priest’s hit points to –19 or more during the delay period, the character regains consciousness and does not die if he receives enough healing to restore him to positive hit points before the delay ends. Even if death occurs, regeneration usually restores a character much more quickly than the rest period the invincibility skill requires. A character returned to life through regeneration need not make a system shock roll.
An amulet of life protection also allows a priest to continue fighting after being reduced to –20 hit points or less if the character receives sufficient healing to restore him to –19 hit points or more. The character still lapses back into death at the end of the delay period, but any form of magical healing can restore him to life and no system shock roll is required.
Each use of the invincibility skill lowers the priest’s base eminence score by two for the rest of the day. The skill is ineffective if the character’s base eminence score is reduced to zero or less.
2 Iron Will
Some people are possessed of an amazing ability to drive themselves on despite injuries or exhaustion that would stop another person in his tracks. A character with the iron will talent gains a +1 bonus to saving throws vs. mind-affecting spells or effects, including charms, holds, hypnotism, fascination, suggestion, and other such spells.
In addition, characters with iron will have the unqiue ability to keep fighting even after being reduced to negative hit points. Each round that the character wishes to remain conscious, he must roll a successful saving throw vs. death with his negative hit point total as a modifier to the roll. For example, a character reduced to –5 hit points can try to stay on his feet and keep moving and fighting by succeeding on a saving throw roll with a –5 penalty. As long as the character remains conscious, his condition does not worsen—in other words, he doesn't begin to lose 1 additional hit point per round until he actually passes out.
2 Jousting
This proficiency includes the combat skills necessary for a successful joust, as well as the manners, behavior, and flair needed to impress an audience. To take this proficiency, a character must first have a weapon specialization in the jousting lance.
A character with this proficiency modifies his attack rolls in a jousting match by +2. The use of this proficiency presumes that the character has an adequate lance, shield, and mount.
Should a character win a match, his stylish performance favorbly impresses the audience. Audience members with a special interest in the match (such as royalty, gamblers, or potential paramours) who later encounter the jouster modify their reaction rolls by +2. If he wins several matches in a tournament, the bonus doesn't rise above +2. If he later loses a match or two in the same tournament, he still earns the bonus. However, if the jouster has an especially disastrous day—say, if he follows a winning joust with a long string of losses—the audience may dismiss the win as a fluke, and the DM may cancel the bonus.
2 Juggling
The character can juggle, a talent useful for entertainments, diversions, and certain rare emergencies. When juggling normally (to entertain or distract), no proficiency check is required. A check is made when trying spectacular tricks ("Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!"). However, juggling also enables the character to attempt desperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a proficiency check), the character can catch small items thrown to harm him (as opposed to items thrown for him to catch). Thus, the character could catch a dagger or a dart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, however, the character automatically suffers damage (sticking your hand in the path of a dagger is likely to hurt).
2 Jumping
The character can attempt exceptional leaps both vertically and horizontally. If the character has at least a 20-foot running start, he can leap (broad jump) 2d6+his level in feet. No character can broad jump more than six times his height, however. With the same start, he can leap vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level in feet. No character can high jump more than 1-½ times his own height.
From a standing start, a character with this proficiency can broad jump 1d6 plus half his level in feet and high jump only three feet.
The character can also attempt vaults using a pole. A vault requires at least a 30-foot running start. If a pole is used, it must be four to 10 feet longer than the character's height. The vault spans a distance equal to 1-½ times the length of the pole. The character can clear heights equal to the height of the pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if the vault carries him over an obstacle no higher than ½ the height of his pole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character could either vault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling into the room beyond), land on his feet in an opening six feet off the ground, or vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped at the end of the vault.
2 Landscape Gardening
No description
2 Languages, Ancient
The character has mastered a difficult and obscure tongue, now primarily found in the writings of pedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use of the language is to read tomes of ancient secrets written by long-dead mystics. This proficiency enables the character to either read and write or speak the language (his choice).
2 Languages, Future
A character with this proficiency may interpret without error a written work from a specified period or, if operating within the period, may speak the language fluently. The character must first be able to speak a modern antecedent of the language before learning the future version of it. This proficiency can only be learned through study in the appropriate time period or through the teachings of another with the desired knowledge.
For example, Articus knows the regional human tongue, as well as the languages of the elves and the dwarves. He also has the future languages proficiency covering the age of discovery. Traveling to this future age, the changes in the languages he knows present no problem, and he is able to speak the dialects with ease. While there, he also encounters a gnome. Since he did not know the gnomish language to begin with, his training in future dialects does not help him.
2 Languages, Modern
The character has learned to speak a language of the known world. To do so, there must be a teacher available. This could be another player character, an NPC hireling, or simply a local townsman.
2 Large Weapons
As explained in Chapter 3 of the I<Concordance of Arcane Space> (see “Weapon Teams”), shipbourne weapons can be used more effectively by weapon specialists. While the I<Concordance> explains how to hire a large-weapons specialist, it does not explain how PCs can themselves become such specialists.
|! Large Weapon Proficiency Costs
|* Weapon Type|Cost in Slots|Groundling
|- Ballista|1|Yes
|- Bombard|2|No
|- Catapult|1|Yes
|- Greek Fire Projector|2|No
|- Jettison|1|No
A character can expend weapon proficiency slots to become expert with one type of large weapon. The are five basic types, each with its own proficiency slot cost, as show in the table.
The Groundling column in the table indicates whether the weapon proficiency is available as a proficiency to characters before they enter space. Weapons marked “No” in the Groundling column are not used on planetary surfaces, so a character who has never been in space cannot be proficient in their use.
Proficiency in a class of weapons gives proficiency in all weapons of that type. Thus, proficiency in catapults includes light, medium, and heavy catapults; proficiency in ballista includes light, medium, and heavy ballistae as well as gnomish sweepers.
2 Law
A character with this proficiency is thoroughly familiar with the legal system of his homeland (or any other region of his choice). He knows which laws are rigorously enforced (illegal gambling may be tolerated in one region, aggressively prosecuted in another), routine legal procedures (such as how to file suit against a debtor), and is skilled in representing cases before judges, officers, nobles, and magistrates. Understanding nuances of the law, such as interpreting fine points of a contract, require proficiency checks.
A successful proficiency check also allows the character to conduct a strong defense when he or a companion stands accused of a crime. If the judge or jury is fair-minded and the evidence of the crime is ambiguous, a successful check will sway the verdict in the defendant's favor; either he receives the smallest possible sentence or fine, or is completely vindicated. However, if the evidence clearly calls for a conviction or the judge is corrupt or intimidated, a successful proficiency check won't help.
A character may spend additional slots to know the legal systems of other regions. Alternately, he may spend slots to acquire expertise in a particular area of the law, such as tax codes or property rights. Expertise assumes a broad understanding of the chosen area, requiring checks only in extreme instances.
(A paladin with the Law proficiency won't defend anyone he believes to be guilty, including his own companions. Though a paladin won't knowingly break the law, he may take advantage of this proficiency to defend himself if wrongly accused of a crime; a failed defense may result in his conviction.)
2 Leadership
A character with this proficiency has a commanding manner that makes others of his own kind inclined to respond favorably. The character adds his level of experience to his Charisma score when determining reaction adjustments (see Chapter 1 of the Player's Handbook). This reaction bonus is only in effect when he deals with people from his homeland; the reaction bonus does not affect those of evil alignment.
Example: Grog, a 7th-level barbarian, has a Charisma score of 13 and the leadership proficiency. According to the Player's Handbook, he has a standard reaction adjustment of + 1. But when dealing with people from his homeland, he has a reaction bonus of + 9 (7+13=20; according to the Player's Handbook, a Charisma of 20 gives a + 9 bonus). When dealing with evil characters from his homeland, however, he uses his standard + 1 bonus.
2 Leatherworking
This proficiency enables a character to tan and treat leather and to make clothing and other leather objects. The character can make leather armor, as well as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and all sorts of harnesses.
2 Light Sleeping
This proficiency lets the character receive the benefits of a full night's rest from a one-hour nap. The character must make a proficiency check before going to sleep. If the check succeeds, the character awakens in an hour, fully refreshed; he recovers the same amount of lost hit points as if he'd rested for eight hours. If the check fails, he remains asleep, awakening as usual. He may use this proficiency only once per week, regardless of whether it fails or succeeds. This proficiency is not effective for purposes of spell memorization.
2 Loan
|* Priest Level|Amount of Loan
|- 15–19|1d8+2 Hit Points
|- 20–24|2d6+4 Hit Points
|- 25–29|3d6+6 Hit Points
|- 30+|4d6+8 Hit Points
Priests with this skill can transfer physical vitality between themselves and other living creatures.
With a successful skill roll, the priest transfers a small amount of his own hit points to a living creature (or vice versa). If the priest tries to borrow hit points from an unwilling donor, an attack roll is required before the character can make the skill roll. The number of hit points that are transferred depends on the priest’s level:
Transferred hit points are immediately subtracted from the donor’s hit point total and added to the recipient’s total. The hit points are lost to the donor, just as though the donor was subjected to a damaging attack. Donated hit points can be restored through rest or magical healing just as any other form of damage. If the donor has insufficient hit points to supply the transfer, only those available are transferred and the donor dies. Transferred hit points remain with the recipient for 24 hours or until lost in an attack.
Each attempt to use this skill lowers the base score by two for one week. The skill is useless once the base score falls to zero or less.
2 Locksmithing
This is the specialized skill of making locks. It is treated like other “craft” proficiencies when checking for success. Also, thieves with this proficiency gain a 10% bonus to their lockpicking skill, because they are intimately familiar with the internal structure and working of so many locks.
Besides troubleshooters, dwarf and gnome thieves of any kit can take the locksmithing proficiency to fill one slot, because of the tradition of craftsmanship and mechanical things in their cultural heritages.
2 Looting
This proficiency represents a knack for grabbing the best loot in the shortest time. For instance, a cat burglar breaks into a room in a wealthy mansion. He has about two minutes to fill his backpack, so that he can escape before guards are summoned by magical alarms. If his proficiency check succeeds, he is able to recognize and stuff into his pack the most valuable combination of items that is feasible, given his limitations of time and space.
2 Masseur
No description
2 Meditative Focus
This proficiency allows a psionicist to focus his mental energy into one discipline, causing all powers within that discipline to receive MTHAC0 roll bonuses; powers related to other disciplines receive MTHAC0 roll penalties.
The psionicist must meditate for 12 consecutive hours. He recovers PSPs normally during this meditative state. When the period ends, the character makes a proficiency check. Success means he has focused his energy into the chosen discipline. All MTHAC0 rolls for powers within that discipline receive a +2 bonus for the next 24 hours or until his PSP total is reduced to 0, whichever comes first. All other disciplines get a –1 penalty for the same period.
2 Medium
No description
2 Mental Armor
This proficiency allows a character to improve his mental armor class (MAC). Each time this proficiency is placed in an available nonweapon slot, the character’s MAC improves. Nonpsionicists improve by +1 for each slot; psionicists improve by +2. The proficiency may only be slotted once per level advancement.
2 Mental Focus
Wizards with this skill can marshal their personal energies to provide a temporary bonus to their Intelligence, Wisdom, or Dexterity scores.
By concentrating for one round and making a successful skill check, the wizard can improve one of the three eligible ability scores to the value listed on the table below. The improvement lasts one round per character level. Because the majority of the character’s energy is directed to the improved ability score, the other two ability scores are reduced by two for the same duration. The wizard can end the boost—and restore the values of the other scores—at any time. If the character’s ability score is already equal to or higher than the value listed on the table, this skill has no effect. If the optional subabilities rule from Skills & Powers is in play, both subabilities in the increased ability score are raised to the same value.
|* Wizard Level|Improved Score
|- 12–16|18
|- 17–20|19
|- 21–25|20
|- 26–29|21
|- 30+|22
The wizard can take no other actions during the round the character is concentrating on raising the selected ability score. Each attempt, successful or not, during a single day lowers the base skill score by two; the skill cannot be used once the base score falls to zero or less.
Bonuses from an increased score are applied immediately when the skill succeeds and are lost immediately when the boost’s duration ends. For example, a wizard who chooses to increase Dexterity immediately gains an improved Armor Class bonus, but loses it again when the character’s Dexterity score returns to normal. Likewise, the effects from reduced ability scores are applied immediately when the improvement ends.
A character can have only one ability score improvement from this skill operating at any given time.
2 Mental Resistance
Through lengthy training and iron discipline, a character with this proficiency prepares himself to resist magical or psionic assaults on his mind. The character receives a +1 bonus to his saving throws against attacks of this nature, if the attack normally allows a saving throw. Generally, this includes any attack form that a character’s magical attack adjustment bonus for his Wisdom score might affect, including mind affecting spells, charm or fear powers of monsters, and telepathic sciences or devotions that allow the subject a saving throw.

2 Mining
A character with mining proficiency is needed to site and supervise the operations of any mine. First, the character can attempt to determine what types of ores or gems can be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend at least a week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule that more area must be searched to find anything of value and may thus increase the amount of time required. At the end of the search, the character can say what is likely to be found in this area. After this, the character can site the mine. On a successful proficiency check (made secretly by the DM), the character has found a good site to begin mining for any minerals that may be in the area. The check does not guarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is the best choice in a given area. The DM must determine what minerals, if any, are to be found in the region of the mine. On a failed check, the character only thinks he has found a good site. Much effort is spent before the character is proved wrong, of course.
Once the mine is in operation, a character with mining proficiency must remain on site to supervise all work. Although this is a steady job, most player characters will find it better to hire an NPC for this purpose.
2 Missile Deflection*
The character can perform block maneuvers (see Chapter Two) against normal missiles fired at her from the front. The character can use her free change of facing (see Chapter One) to turn toward an attacker firing missiles from her flank or rear, but this counts as her change of facing for the round.
Normal missiles include mundane and enchanted arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, small stones, and spears. Large or magical missiles, such as ballista bolts, hurled boulders, and magic missile spells, cannot be deflected.
2 Mosaic
The character is skilled at inlaying pieces of stone into a baseplate of stone, creating pleasing patterns and images. The work is nearly as long lasting as Maztican stonework, and is used to decorate walls and floors.
2 Mountaineering
A character with this proficiency can make difficult and dangerous climbs up steep slopes and cliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with mountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons (spikes) and guiding the others, all in the party can gain the benefit of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide a party up a cliff face it could not otherwise climb. A character with this proficiency gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to his chance to climb any surface. Note that mountaineering is not the same as the thief's climbing ability, since the latter does not require aids of any sort.
2 Musical Instrument
The character can play a specific musical instrument. An additional instrument can be added for every extra slot devoted to this proficiency. The character plays quite well, and no proficiency check is normally required. The DM may direct the character to make a proficiency check in what he feels are extraordinary circumstances.
2 Natural Fighting
This proficiency allows humanoids with natural weaponry (claws, fangs, tails, etc.) a +1 damage bonus on all natural weapon attacks. In addition, they receive a free natural attack beyond normal attacks they are allowed. A successful proficiency check must be made at the beginning of combat to gain the benefits of this skill. Failure indicates that the benefits cannot be used for the duration of the battle.
2 Navigation
The character has learned the arts of navigating by the stars, studying currents, and watching for telltale signs of land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is not particularly useful on land. At sea, a successful proficiency check by the navigator reduces the chance of getting lost by 20 percent.
2 Navigation, Phlogiston
This is the art of navigating from one sphere to another, a separate skill from navigating within a single crystal sphere. It is a difficult and risky activity, but it is sometimes necessary when a planatary locator is not available.
A spelljamming ship that enters the Flow normally moves randomly, arriving at some other crystal sphere within 10-100 days. With a successful proficiency check from the ship's navigator, the ship arrives at the chosen destination within that time. Of course, the destination must be one that is normally reachable; if there is no path from the current sphere to the desired one, a successful check on this proficiency will not create one.
If the proficiency check is failed, the ship arrives at a random sphere. (The DM should make the proficiency rolll so that the player does not know if he succeed or not.) On a natural 20, the ship drifts in the phlogiston for 20-200 days; such ships may be in grave danger of exhausting their air supply before returning to a random crystal sphere.
2 Navigation, Underground
A character with this proficiency can determine direction underground and the shortest route to the surface. By careful analysis of air currents and contents, a character can even determine whether there are any pockets of poisonous gas in the air. A successful proficiency check is required to use the proficiency.
2 Navigation, Wildspace
The character has learned the art of navigating through wildspace, avoiding hazards and using planatary motion to improve speed over long journeys. A successful profieciency check allows the character's spelljamming vessel to arrive at its wildspace destination 10% faster than normal. Thus, if it would take 10 days to makethe trip normally, the character can steer a course that will take only nine days. An unsuccessful proficiency check indicates that no time is saved; on a roll of 20, travel time increases by 20%.
2 Necrology
A character with this skill is well versed in the lore of undead creatures. This proficiency may be used to help determine the probable lairs, dining habits, and history of such creatures (no ability check needed). Whenever a character with this skill confronts an undead, he or she may be able to specifically identify the creature (discerning between a ghast and a common ghoul, for instance). In addition, providing the character makes another successful ability check, he or she recalls the creature's specific weaknesses and natural defenses or immunities. At the DM's discretion, a failed ability check (in either of these cases) will reveal misleading or even completely erroneous information which may actually strengthen or otherwise benefit the undead.
2 Netherworld Knowledge
With this proficiency, a character learns about the cosmology and organization of the AD&amp;D® game multiverse, focusing primarily on the ultimate destination of spirits after death: the Outer Planes. In addition, the character learns about the behavior of the dangerous creatures that inhabit the nether regions, including such fiends as the tanar'ri and the baatezu. As with necrology (which applies exclusively to undead), netherworld knowledge can reveal the specific weaknesses and natural immunities of beings from the Outer Planes. The proficiency can also be used to classify the exact type of extraplanar creature encountered. Both of these abilities require an ability check, however.
2 Night Vision
This proficiency improves a character's ability to see in low-light conditions. It is not equal to infravision but is still useful.
To use his Night Vision, the character must spend five rounds in the type of light he will be moving or waiting in. Until he has spent that amount of time in the dark, this proficiency just does not work. (However, the character can be doing other things while letting his eyes adjust, so long as these other tasks do not expose him to varying light conditions.)
Once his eyes have adjusted, the character can use his Night Vision at any time. Whenever he looks at something, he must make a Night Vision proficiency check. With a successful check, the character's Visibility Ranges (from the Player's Handbook, Chapter 13) are doubled in the following conditions: Fog (dense or blizzard), Fog (moderate), Night (full moon), Night (no moon), Twilight. Thus, a character under a full moon at night would be able to spot movement at 200 feet rather than at 100 feet.
If the character with this proficiency is exposed to a change in illumination—such as by having a fireball go off within 500 feet or by having a torch or lamp waved in his face—his eyes are dazzled. His Night Vision is gone and cannot be regained until the character has again spent five rounds letting his eyes adjust.

2 Nondetection
Rogues with this skill can shield themselves from many types of magical divination, as the 3rd level wizard spell of the same name.
When subjected to a spell such as ESP, clairaudience, or detect invisibility, or to a magical item such as a crystal ball, a successful skill check defeats the spell or device. Even if the roll fails, the rogue is still entitled to any applicable saving throws.
This skill is also effective against the sense danger skill, the priest’s detect deception skill, and the ability of intelligent or powerful creatures to detect invisible opponents. When subjected to one of these powers, the rogue can attempt an opposed Wisdom/Willpower check to remain undetected.
This skill is not effective against the spells know alignment, true seeing, commune, or contact other plane, nor is this skill effective against the detection abilities of legendary monsters, wyrm and great wyrm dragons, and deities.

2 Observation
Characters with this proficiency have cultivated exceptional powers of observation. The DM may ask for a proficiency check anytime there is something subtly wrong or unusual in the character’s environment. For example, the character may note the fact that the tools of a potter’s shop are caked with a different kind of clay than that present in the workshop, or he might notice telltale marks of traffic that indicate the presence of a secret door. The DM shouldn’t let this become a substitute for alertness and good thinking on the part of the player; if he’s picking up more than one or two clues a game session with this proficiency, it’s probably too many. The DM may ask for a proficiency check (or secretly roll it himself) anytime there is something subtly askew; he may also allow characters with observation to increase their chance of finding secret or concealed doors by 1 in 6. The proficiency covers all the senses.
2 Obsidian Working
|! Maztican Weapon Work
|* c3 Time and Obsidian Requirements
|* Weapon|Work Time|Fraction of a load/item
|- Arrowhead|1-4 per hour|1/1000
|- Maca|10 days|5%
|- Spearhead|1 day|2%
|- Knife|20 days|5%
|- Repair|Item 1-6 hours|1%
The character can create edges for knives, arrowheads, spearblades, and macas from the volcanic glass of obsidian. The character is also skilled at identifying the areas where obsidian can be found. Once he discovers an area, he can gather a full load—as much as a person can carry—in one day.
The character can also perform repairs on obsidian edged weapons that are damaged in use—see the Equipment Section for details on breakage.
The material is easier and faster to work with than steel, though of course it needs to be replaced more often. Typical work rates for Obsidian crafts are listed on the table.
2 Omen Interpretation
No description
2 Omen Reading
There are hundreds of myths and superstitions about the art of divination, or predicting the future through the reading of signs or indications. A character with this proficiency is skilled in a form of divination and knows the proper ceremonies and observances to use in order to obtain a valid reading. He is also familiar with the various messages or indications that characterize a form of divination. Omen readers use dozens of different methods for their auguries, including astrology, numerology, reading palms, examining animal entrails, casting bones, dice, or runes, and burning incense to observe the smoke, just to name a few. The exact nature of the character’s expertise is up to the player.
To use this proficiency, the omen reader phrases a general question about a course of action, such as “Is this a good day to start our journey?,” “Should we try to track the orcs to their lair, or wait for their next raid?,” or “When will the dragon return?” The DM then makes a proficiency check in secret; if the character fails, the DM can tell him that the signs were inconclusive, or make up a false answer for a spectacular failure (a natural 20 on the check, for instance). If the omen reader succeeds, the DM can give the character a vague answer based on his assessment of the situation. An omen is usually good, bad, or inconclusive, although an answer of “a day or two” or “proceed, but with caution” is acceptable as well. Omens aren’t guaranteed; if a party ignores a bad omen, they might succeed in their task anyway. An omen is nothing more than the DM’s best guess about a course of action.
Performing the ceremony of reading an omen requires an hour or more. Special tools or supplies, such as runesticks, may be necessary depending on the character’s favored form of omen reading. Some superstitious or primitive cultures may place a great deal of weight on omen reading, and a skilled diviner may be held in high regard by these people.
2 Oratory/Oration
Through inspiring speech and sheer force of personality, a character with this proficiency can influence the opinion of a crowd. Any size crowd may be influenced, so long as they speak the same language as the orator, and can see and hear him clearly.
To use this proficiency, the orator must address the crowd on one specific topic. For instance, he may attempt to persuade them to rise up against a local despot, leave town because of an impending danger (a monster on the outskirts of town, an advancing evil army), or help search for a missing child.
Before the orator speaks, the DM must determine the size of the crowd, their level, and their general attitude toward the orator and the topic he's addressing. For small crowds—say, less than five members—determine levels and attitudes individually. Break larger crowds into groups; decide an average level and attitude for each group. Use Table 59 in Chapter 11 of the DMG to access attitudes about the topic; the crowd may be Friendly, Indifferent, Cautious, Threatened, or Hostile.
Before any rolls are made, or the orator begins speaking, the player tells the DM if the orator will be attempting to adjust the crowd's opinion one level up or down on Table 59. The orator then speaks to the crowd; he must speak uninterrupted for at least 10 rounds.
When the orator finishes speaking, roll the Oratory proficiency check. If the check succeeds, make an Intelligence check for each individual in a small crowd, or for each small group in a large crowd. Modify these rolls by a –1 penalty for each 1 by which the orator made the Oratory check. For instance, if the Orator needed a 10 to succeed and rolled a 5, each Intelligence check takes a –5 penalty. If the player presents an especially moving argument or speech, the proficiency check is made with a +1 to +4 bonus.
Individuals or small groups who fail their throws have their opinions about the topic adjusted one level on Table 59 in the DMG. An Indifferent opinion may become Friendly or Cautious, a Cautious opinion may become Indifferent or Threatening. However, all audience members who fail their rolls have their opinions adjusted the same way. The opinions of those who succeed in their rolls remain unchanged by the character's Oratory; however, practically speaking, peer pressure can produce the same results. The DM may override any die roll that produces inappropriate results; for example, an NPC in the crowd who has a long-standing feud with the orator may be unswayed, regardless of the orator's eloquence.
A character may use this proficiency only once on a given crowd. Should the composition of the crowd change to include many new members, the character may make another oratory attempt, providing he speaks on a different topic.
Note that this proficiency elicits only modest changes in attitude. If a crowd feels Indifferent towards a despot, an orator may be able to stir up some ambiguous feelings about him, but he won't be able to convince them to immediately storm the despot's castle. If the crowd is suspicious of a particular religion, the orator may persuade them to be more tolerant, but he shouldn't expect any spontaneous conversions.
2 Orienteering
This is the ability to keep one’s bearings on roadless, trackless land. Proficient characters will not get lost as long as they can either see the sky or have the use of a compass. This means that they can maintain track of a given direction, keeping themselves and their companions traveling in a straight line.
Characters who possess a map and can track their direction of travel can arrive at specific points—towns, ferry crossings, bridges, monuments, wells, springs, etc.—without proficiency checks.
If the map is slightly erroneous, or lacking in crucial details, the characters will have to make successful proficiency checks to accurately arrive at a specific point. This check can be modified for increased difficulty based on poor weather or major problems with the map.
2 Painting
A character with this proficiency is skilled at rendering images with oil, brush, and canvas. The artist can create reasonable portrayals of people, landscapes, and monsters, and he possesses a knowledge of perspective, shading, and composition. If this proficiency is coupled with the artistic talent trait, the character receives +2 to his base painting score and can create stunningly realistic works, capable of stirring profound reactions in observers—and perhaps worth gold to wealthy NPCs.
2 Papermaking
A character with this skill knows how to manufacture paper. This can be an invaluable skill for a wizard, since paper may be fairly rare in many campaign settings. Rag pulp, bark, linen, hemp, and wood were all used to make paper in medieval times. The material is pounded or pressed flat and treated with various chemical compounds to bind and strengthen it. At the DM’s option, the character may also be familiar with the manufacture of parchment and vellum. Parchment is finely scraped animal skin, treated with lime and other chemicals; vellum is unusually supple and smooth parchment taken from very young animals.
A wizard who makes his own paper can reduce the costs of manufacturing a spell book by 50%, although this requires one to two weeks of time and a suitable work area. Normally, a traveling spell book costs 100 gp per page, and a standard spell book costs 50 gp per page. If the wizard also knows the bookbinding nonweapon proficiency and binds the volume himself, the cost of the spell book is reduced by 75% altogether.
2 Persuasion
This proficiency enables the character to make a compelling argument to convince a subject NPC character to see things his way, respond more favorably, or comply with a request. The character engages the NPC in conversation for at least 10 rounds (meaning that the subject must be willing to talk with the character in the first place); subjects whose attitudes are threatening or hostile aren't affected by this proficiency.
With a successful proficiency check, he can convince them to take moderate actions they may be considering already; for example, he may convince city guards to leave without making arrests if a brawl’s already finished by the time they get there, or he may convince a court official that he needs an audience with the king. If the player’s thoughts and arguments are particularly eloquent and acute, the proficiency check is made with a +1 to +4 bonus.
2 Pest Control
This proficiency is used to keep dwarf strongholds free of pests like rats, carrion crawlers, jermalaines, kobolds, and other small creatures. Similar to the set snares proficiency, it is concerned with catching underground pests and does not use snares. Traps are set to trigger metal cages, drop nets, or iron doors that shut off individual tunnel sections. Spring traps or small deadfalls may be rigged (damage 1d6 maximum) using this proficiency. There is no -4 modifier when using pest control to trap larger creatures.
Only thief characters may use this proficiency to rig larger traps suitable for human or orc sized creatures. These traps may include crossbows, larger deadfalls, and spiked springboards.
A character with this proficiency does not have the ability to make the items required for these devices, he can only set the traps and their triggers.
A proficiency check must be rolled when the trap is set. A failed proficiency check means that the trap will fail to operate. It may not have been set properly, was poorly concealed, or it was too small or too large for the creature to trigger.
Setting a trap takes one hour and the character must have the proper equipment and materials with him.
Characters with the animal lore proficiency gain a +2 bonus when attempting to set traps to catch animal pests.
2 Philosophy

2 Planar Sense
Similar to skill of weather sense, this proficiency allows a basher to predict the imminent conditions on any plane.  Random changes in the air breathability, gravity, ground stability, temperature change, and so on can be predicted up to one hour before they occur.  For example, the use of this proficiency on the ever-changing plane of Limbo can warn of a sudden rain of fire, a wave of acidic snow, or a blast of poisonous air.
This proficiency is of great use on chaotic planes, but is rarely helpful on the unchanging planes of law.
2 Planetology
A character with the planetology proficiency has studied the various types of planets that may be found within crystal spheres. He is able to identify sings of groundling civilization from space and can determine the climate and probable inhabitants of a world by studying if for a short time (and making a successful proficiency check).
2 Planology
This proficiency allows a character to examine planar events and predict the future, using a device called a celestial etheroscope (see page 134, Planeswalker Handbook #2620).  It is similiar to the astrology proficiency, although its results are more general.
By observing various planar events through an etheroscope, a character can predict the tides of fortune on a plane.  A blood can obtain five different types of results.
* (1)  Castastrophe.  Something horrible is going to happen on the plane in question
* (2-5)  Bad luck.  All signs point to negative karma on the plane in question.  Minor bad things happen in the lives of the natives, and vistors are at -1 on all die rolls until the phase pases.
* (6-15)  Status quo.  Things aren't going to change drastically for a while.
* (16-19)  Good fortune.  The plane is blessed with positive energy.  Good things happen for the natives, and nonnatives recieve a +1 bonus to all die rolls for the duration of the phase.
* (20)  Providence.  Something extremely wondeful happens on the plane (for the inhabitants).
Numbers in parenthesis allow the DM to determine random occurances (roll 1d20), although most often a DM should choose an appropriate result based on his foreknowledge of upcoming adventures.  Random rolls, however, may provide adventure hooks.  Regardless, good or bad luck has nothing to do with alignment; some wonderful development for the yugoloths on Gehenna may mean somthing terrible for the forces of good everywhere else.  Similarly, a person of evil alignment who visits Elysium during a phase of good fortune still recieves the benfit, since providence transends alignment.  Phases of fortune can last as long as the DM wishes, but no more than a week is suggested, and some times they might last no more than a few minutes.
Determining the current tides of fortune on a plane requires a regular proficiency check.  The check modifier has a cumulative -1 penatly for each day into the future the priest or wizard attempts to look.  Failed checks at any time reveal inaccurate results, or no results at all.  Failure also denies any further attempts for that time period.
2 Poetry
A character taking this proficiency specializes in either lyric or narrative poetry. Lyric poetry expresses thoughts and feelings, and includes ballads, sonnets, odes, and hymns. Narrative poetry tells stories in verse, some true, some fictional. A character spending two slots may specialize in both forms.
The proficiency enables the character to judge the quality of poetry in his specialty. He also knows a sizeable repertoire of poems and can recite them with spellbinding skill. No proficiency checks are required for these applications.
The character can also compose poems in his speciality; a successful check means the poem is of exceptional quality. If the character has the Reading/Writing proficiency, he can record his poems.
With permission from the DM, a paladin with the Poetry proficiency may offer a composition to his church (or other designated recipient) instead of a tithe. The paladin must inform the church a month in advance if he intends to offer a composition; either lyric or narrative poetry is acceptable. If the church (that is, the DM) disapproves, the paladin must pay his normal tithe. If the church approves, the paladin may present a composition when his tithe is normally due.
The composition must be presented at the church or to a church official at a pre-arranged location. The paladin then makes a Poetry proficiency check. If the check fails, the composition is deemed unworthy; the normal tithe must be paid immediately. If the check succeeds, the DM determines the value of the composition; the value is equal to 3d20 gp. If the value is greater than or equal to the normal tithe, no tithe is required that month. The paladin doesn't receive any "change'' if the value is more than his tithe; the excess value is forfeited.
If the value is less than the tithe, the paladin subtracts the value from the tithe, then pays the difference (if the paladin owes 20 gp and the value of the composition is 15 gp, he must pay 5 gp). A paladin may exercise this option as often as he likes.

2 Portal Feel
Sometimes a planeswalker needs to know what's on the other side of a portal or gate before he steps through.  This proficiency also allows a cutter a chance to determine the portal's exit point.  This proficiency is used in two ways.
First, a successful check at a -3 penalty grants a general feel for safety.  By intuition and observation, a planeswalker determines whether a given portal leads into a setting or situation of direct and immediate harm.  Obviously this requires the DM's interpretation.
A second successful check at -5 penatly divines the location of the other end of a gate or portal.  The planeswalker may not learn the exact site or position, but at the very least the charcater'll learn the destination plane.  This proficiency doesn't tell the character about the gate key required to open the portal.
2 Pottery
A character with this proficiency can create any type of clay vessel or container commonly used in the campaign world. The character requires a wheel and a kiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. The character can generally create two small- or medium-sized items or one large-sized item per day. The pieces of pottery must then be fired in the kiln for an additional day.
The raw materials involved cost 3 cp to make a small item, 5 cp to make a medium-sized item, and 1 sp to make a large item.
2 Power Manipulation
Power manipulation is the skill of amplifying a psionic power or devotion. This proficiency can only be used to manipulate powers in the psionicist’s primary discipline. When the psionicist initiates or maintains a psionic power, he may use power manipulation to boost its effects. First he initiates the power with a normal power check. Then he may attempt power manipulation by making a proficiency check. The attempt incurs an addi-tional cost of 5 PSPs, whether he succeeds or fails. If the character makes a successful proficiency check, he achieves the result listed for that devotion’s power score.
If the psionicist rolls a natural 20 on the proficiency check, he botches the manipulation attempt and suffers the ill effects of rolling a 20 for that devotion’s power check.
2 Prestidigitation
This is the art of street magic or sleight of hand, the trade of the magician. The character is skilled at concealing or manipulating small items and familiar with such tricks as pulling a coin from a child’s ear, separating two joined rings, or causing a pigeon or rabbit to vanish. For the most part, nothing more than manual dexterity and showmanship are required, and any kind of character may learn prestidigitation.
While true wizards have little time for these parlor tricks, many apprentices practice with their cantrips by duplicating these feats. A wizard with a cantrip spell handy can really manipulate a small object by briefly levitating it, teleport something small from one hand to the other, or use a tiny dimensional pocket to make an object disappear or seem to contain something it shouldn’t.
There is no particular game effect for prestidigitation, although it is a form of entertainment and can earn a wizard his dinner with a good performance, or possibly distract or fool an NPC under very limited circumstances. For example, a wizard trying to conceal a wand or precious gem from a robber searching him at knifepoint might be able to hide the item with a successful proficiency check.
2 Prophecy
3 From Chronomany
(Wis -1 Wizards)
This can be used to analyze prophecies for hidden meanings and validity or to construct a prophecy of the chronomancer's own. If confronted with any portion of a prophecy, a successful check alerts the character.
To analyze an existing prophecy, a certain amount of research is necessary. This depends greatly upon the particular prophecy but should entail 1d6 days of research. Once this has been completed, the character makes five proficiency checks. The first determines which pieces of the prophecy are important. The next helps the character decide just how far this prophecy reaches (whether it involves a single town or could affect an empire). Another check tells the character the state of the prophecy's timing. The next check reveals how the prophecy should conclude. The final check tells who is behind the prophecy or approximately where a certain person or group fits in (that a major member of the prophecy must play the part of the king's advisor in order for it to work, for example). If any check (rolled by the DM) is failed but the roll is less than 20, no conclusion can be reached, and no further rolls can be made. Further research (say another 1d4 days) allows the character to pick up at the failed proficiency check and proceed until another failure forces more research. If the check roll is a 20, the error is not caught, and the character proceeds with other rolls, all of which are wrong since they are based on faulty assumptions.
Once all of the rolls have been made, the character may make an additional check at -2. This check should give the character a few ideas on how to help or hinder the prophecy (at the DM's discretion, of course).
This proficiency can also be used to construct a prophecy. Three checks are necessary for this to work. To use it, the character must first have some actual knowledge of the event to be prophesied. For every 20 years in the future the event is, a -1 penalty applies.
The first check gains the player some idea from the DM on motivations for the people affected by the prophecy (why they would want to remember and believe in it). A second check, along with proper action by the character (like presenting to the king a magical sword that is predicted to kill a dragon), establishes the actual beginning of the prophecy. A third check evaluates the work done and finds the weakest spots. If detailed, first-hand knowledge of the future is used, the checks are made without the -1 modifier.
The character can use this skill to solve a prophecy set forth by the DM. Wits and good role-playing can help. Conversely, when making a prophecy, the player should actually write it down, leaving it for the DM to misinterpret as he likes.
3 From Sages and Specialists
(Wis -2 Anyone)
This proficiency allows a seer to convey the information he recieves through divination magic in a fairly understandable way.  Most information gleaned through divinatory methods comes to the seer in quick, almost explosive visions, or nearly incomprehensible words.  The seer can use this prophecy to "translate" those visions and words into a format more easily understood by normal men and women.
This is not to say that such messages become crystal clear.  In fact, these prophecies are still couched in enigmatic and cyptic language.  However, a seer's warnings would be totally incomprehensible.
Once a seer recieves a prophetic vision through the use of his magic, he must make a Prophecy proficiency check.  Failure means that he was unable to convey the message of his vision in a way that anyone else can understand.
The seer can also use this proficiency to decipher prophecies made by others.  In order to do this, the seer must have the complete prophecy- either written down or memorized- on hand.  He then makes a proficiency check with a -2 penalty.  If he succeeds, he is able to get a general sense of the prophecy.  failure, however, indicates that the seer could not decipher the prophecy.
If the seer fails to interpret a prophecy, he cannot take another shot at it until he has had a full night's sleep.  Once he wakes up with a refreshed mind, the seer can attempt to interpret the prophecy again.
If the prophecy is a particularly long or complicated one, the DM can require several proficiency checks on the seer's part.  Each time a check is past, the DM should give the seer a short clue as to the meaning of a particular passage from the prophecy.  It's still up to the seer to piece the whole thing together.
If a seer critically fails (rolls a 20) his proficiency check when deciphering a prophecy, he comes up with an interpretation that is totally incorrect.  However, he is unaware or his error.
The misintepretation should be something stated by the DM so that the seer (and any who believe his intepretation) will actually work to make the prophecy come true if they are trying to prevent it.  For example, if the prophecy states that the party should destroy Oghar's gem, the seer misconstrues the warning and tells the party that they must protect the item.  Conversely, if they are struggling to bring the prophecy to fruition, this intepretation will actually set them at cross-purposes to their true desires.
If the seer entirely misinterpreted a prophecy, he cannot attempt to reinterpret it until he is conclusively shown his error.  In addition, he requires a full night's rest before attempting to interpret the prophecy again.
No equipment is required to make use of this nonweapon proficiency.  All the seer needs is either the message from a spell to turn into prophecy or a prophecy which someone else has made.
2 Psionic Detection
The psionic detection proficiency works much as the metapsionic devotion psionic sense, but is much less powerful.  With this proficiency, a character uses latent psionic ability to detect the expenditure of psionic strength pointnts (PSPs) around him.
When employing this proficiency, a character must clear his mind and concentrate, taking at least one full round to prepare.  A successful check allows the character to detect the expenditure of any PSPs within 50 yards of his location, regardless of intervening material objects.  A character can maintain use of the proficiency for successive rounds, but during that time he cannot move or perform any other action.  The proficiency check, however, must succeed on the round that PSPs are expended or the character detects nothing.
Psionic detection proficiency can only inform a character that PSPs were expended within 50 yards, telling nothing more.  The detector cannot determine the number of PSPs, their source, the powers or devotions drwan upon, or the purpose of the expidenture (e.g., to initialize a power or to maintain one).  This proficiancy is not cumulative with other detection techniques.
A player whose character has psionic detection proficiency should ensure that the DM knows.  Often the DM will secretly roll the proficiency and inform the player of results.
2 Psionic Lore
This proficiency represents the study o famous masters of the Way and the methodology of developing mental powers. The character is versed in the standard powers and effects. With a successful proficiency check, the character can identify the general effects of any psionic devotion o science. For example, the character encoun-ters a dwarf walking across a silt basin without sinking. With a successful check, he can determine that the dwarf is using the Body Equilibrium devotion.
The second benefit of this proficiency is the ability to recognize attack patterns in mental combat. If the char-acter makes a proficiency check with a –4 penalty, he is able to guess which attack and defense modes his opponent will be using that round and select his own modes accordingly. The DM should make this check in secret; if the PC fails the check, randomly decide which powers he thinks his opponent is using.
If two characters with psionic lore engage in mental combat, the character with the highest successful profi-ciency check is able to read his opponent’s intentions. If the proficiency checks are the same, neither character gains any information.
2 Psychic Defense
Some people are able to develop a rudimentary psionic defense, although they are not psionicists. They may be born with exceptionally strong Wills, or they may have met a teacher who instructed them in the basics of psionic self-defense.
When a character with this proficiency is attacked by contact or one of the five telepathic attack modes, he may attempt to defend himself mentally. This must be declared after the attacker has announced his attack, but before he resolves it—the defending character can’t wait to see if the attack succeeds.
If the defender makes a successful proficiency check, he manages to prevent contact for that one attack. Each subsequent mental attack provides a cumulative –4 penalty to the proficiency check, so a character who has been attacked three times in one encounter makes his check with a –12 penalty. Unlike a psionicist, whose attackers need three tangents to force contact, the general defender is bested the first time his attacker succeeds and he fails his psychic defense roll.
While a character is defending himself psionically, he may move and defend himself normally. However, he may not cast spells or initiate any wild talents. The psychic defender can make melee or missile attacks, but he suffers a –4 penalty to any attack rolls he makes since his attention is divided between his physical surroundings and the mental assault.
2 Quick Study
This proficiency allows a ninja to temporarily learn enough about a skill, a job, or an area of scholarship to pass as someone who belongs to a related profession.
When using this proficiency, the ninja spends one week (eight hours a day) studying the skill she wishes to learn. At the end of the week, the character has a working knowledge of the field studied. Over the next several days, she will be able to pass as a practitioner of that skill, though not as an expert.
When she has completed his study and must utilize the skill, the character makes a normal proficiency check with an additional –3 penalty. One week after the character has completed her study, she suffers a –2 penalty because she has forgotten some details of the skill. Each week thereafter, she takes another cumulative –2 penalty.
This proficiency will not allow a character to demonstrate an expert level of ability with the skill being simulated. If the character undertakes a task that, in the DM's estimation, calls for an especially broad or deep knowledge of the subject, the DM can decide that the character cannot perform the task. The character can then make a normal Intelligence check; success means that she realizes that she's in over her head and cannot succeed.
It is not possible to spend extra nonweapon proficiency slots on Quick Study to improve the roll. However, it is possible to buy the proficiency more than once in order to study two skills per mission.
2 Quickness
A character with this talent is unusually fast. Her hand-eye coordination is excellent, and she can often get past her opponent's defenses before they realize how quick she really is. In combat, she gains a special –2 bonus to her initiative roll if she makes a proficiency check. She can use this bonus if she moves or makes an attack with a weapon of average speed or quicker, but her special bonus does not apply to attacks with slow weapons or stationary actions such as guarding or parrying.
2 Reading Lips
The character can understand the speech of those he can see but not hear. When this proficiency is chosen, the player must specify what language the character can lip read (it must be a language the character can already speak). To use the proficiency, the character must be within 30 feet of the speaker and be able to see him speak. A proficiency check is made. If the check fails, nothing is learned. If the check is successful, 70% of the conversation is understood. Since certain sounds are impossible to differentiate, the understanding of a lip-read conversation is never better than this.
2 Reading/Writing
The character can read and write a modern language he can speak, provided there is someone available to teach the character (another PC, a hireling, or an NPC). This proficiency does not enable the character to learn ancient languages (see Languages, Ancient).
2 Rejuvination
This proficiency allows a psionicist to recover PSPs more quickly than is usual by entering a rejuvenating trance. This state of deep concentration requires a successful proficiency check. For every hour a hero maintains this trance (and makes the check), he regains PSPs at twice the usual rate (one quarter of his total instead of one eighth). He can’t expend PSPs while in this trance, and his state is much like deep sleep.
2 Religion
Characters with religion proficiency know the common beliefs and cults of their homeland and the major faiths of neighboring regions. Ordinary information (type of religious symbol used, basic attitude of the faith, etc.) of any religion is automatically known by the character. Special information, such as how the clergy is organized or the significance of particular holy days, requires a proficiency check.
Additional proficiencies spent on religion enable the character either to expand his general knowledge into more distant regions (using the guidelines above) or to gain precise information about a single faith. If the latter is chosen, the character is no longer required to make a proficiency check when answering questions about that religion. Such expert knowledge is highly useful to priest characters when dealing with their own and rival faiths.
2 Research
A wizard with this skill is well versed in the theory and application of spell research. He is familiar with the use of libraries, laboratories, and other resources, and also has a good grasp of the fundamental processes of experimentation and problem solving. With a successful proficiency check, the character gains a +5% bonus to his success roll when researching a new spell and only requires one half the usual amount of time to perform spell research or determine the process necessary to manufacture a particular magical item. However, the amount of money spent on research remains the same because the wizard is still expending the same amount of books and supplies.
2 Rhetoric
No description
2 Riding, Airborne
The character is trained in handling a flying mount. The particular creature must be chosen when the proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can be used to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike land-based riding, a character must have this proficiency (or ride with someone who does) to handle a flying mount. In addition, a proficient character can do the following:
* Leap onto the saddle of the creature (when it is standing on the ground) and spur it airborne as a single action. This requires no proficiency check.
* Leap from the back of the mount and drop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back of another mount (land-based or flying). Those with only light encumbrance can drop to the ground without a proficiency check. In all other situations, a proficiency check is required. A failed roll means the character takes normal falling damage (for falling flat on his face) or misses his target (perhaps taking large amounts of damage as a result). A character who is dropping to the ground can attempt an immediate melee attack, if his proficiency check is made with a -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has the consequences given above.
* Spur his mount to greater speeds on a successful check, adding 1d4 to the movement rate of the mount. This speed can be maintained for four consecutive rounds. If the check fails, an attempt can be made again the next round. If two checks fail, no attempt can be made for a full turn. After the rounds of increased speed, its movement drops to 2/3 its normal rate and its Maneuverability Class (see Glossary) becomes one class worse. These conditions last until the mount lands and is allowed to rest for at least one hour.
* The rider can guide the mount with his knees and feet, keeping his hands free. A proficiency check is made only after the character suffers damage. If the check is failed, the character is knocked from the saddle. A second check is allowed to see if the character manages to catch himself (thus hanging from the side by one hand or in some equally perilous position). If this fails, the rider falls. Of course a rider can strap himself into the saddle, although this could be a disadvantage if his mount is slain and plummets toward the ground.
* A ranger cannot use his species enemy as an airborne or land-based mount.
* When riding his bonded mount, a paladin automatically has all of the benefits of the relevant Riding proficiency; he doesn't need the proficiency itself. But if he has the Riding proficiency, he gains a +2 bonus when making all associated checks with his mount. If he has a pegasus bonded mount, he suffers a –2 penalty (instead of –4) when making checks to see if he falls from his saddle after suffering damage. The bonuses apply only when riding the bonded mount. When riding a creature of the same species as the bonded mount, use the normal Riding proficiency rules.

2 Riding, Horse Specialization

2 Riding, Land-Based
Those skilled in land riding are proficient in the art of riding and handling horses or other types of ground mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled, the character must declare which type of mount he is proficient in. Possibilities include griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and virtually any creatures used as mounts by humans, demihumans, or humanoids.
A character with riding proficiency can perform all of the following feats. Some of them are automatic, while others require a proficiency check for success.
* The character can vault onto a saddle whenever the horse or other mount is standing still, even when the character is wearing armor. This does not require a proficiency check. The character must make a check, however, if he wishes to get the mount moving during the same round in which he lands in its saddle. He must also make a proficiency check if he attempts to vault onto the saddle of a moving mount. Failure indicates that the character falls to the ground--presumably quite embarrassed.
* The character can urge the mount to jump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No check is required if the obstacle is less than three feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet wide. If the character wants to roll a proficiency check, the mount can be urged to leap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump across gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success means that the mount has made the jump. Failure indicates that it balks, and the character must make another proficiency check to see whether he retains his seat or falls to the ground.
* The character can spur his steed on to great speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the animal's movement rate for up to four turns. This requires a proficiency check each turn to see if the mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial check fails, no further attempts may be made, but the mount can move normally. If the second or subsequent check fails, the mount immediately slows to a walk, and the character must dismount and lead the animal for a turn. In any event, after four turns of racing, the steed must be walked by its dismounted rider for one turn.
* The character can guide his mount with his knees, enabling him to use weapons that require two hands (such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted. This feat does not require a proficiency check unless the character takes damage while so riding. In this case, a check is required and failure means that the character falls to the ground and sustains an additional 1d6 points of damage.
* The character can drop down and hang alongside the steed, using it as a shield against attack. The character cannot make an attack or wear armor while performing this feat. The character's Armor Class is lowered by 6 while this maneuver is performed. Any attacks that would have struck the character's normal Armor Class are considered to have struck the mount instead. No proficiency check is required.
* The character can leap from the back of his steed to the ground and make a melee attack against any character or creature within 10 feet. The player must roll a successful proficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On a failed roll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.
* A ranger cannot use his species enemy as an airborne or land-based mount.
* When riding his bonded mount, a paladin automatically has all of the benefits of the relevant Riding proficiency; he doesn't need the proficiency itself. But if he has the Riding proficiency, he gains a +2 bonus when making all associated checks with his mount. For instance, if he has a war horse bonded mount and this proficiency, he earns a +2 bonus when attempting to vault into the saddle when the mount is moving. The bonuses apply only when riding the bonded mount. When riding a creature of the same species as the bonded mount, use the normal Riding proficiency rules.
2 Riding, Sea Based
This proficiency allows the character to handle a particular species of sea-based mount The type of mount must be specified when the proficiency is acquired. The character may spend additional slots to enable him to handle other species.
In addition to riding the mount, the proficiency enables the character to do the following:
* When the mount is on the surface of the water, the character can leap onto its back and spur it to move in the same round. No proficiency check is required.
* The character can urge the mount to leap over obstacles in the water that are less than 3' high and 5' across (in the direction of the jump). No proficiency check is required. Greater jumps require a proficiency check, with bonuses or penalties assigned by the DM according to the height and breadth of the obstacle and the type and size of mount. Failure means the mount balks; an immediate second check determines if the character stays on the mount or falls off.
* The character can spur the mount to great speeds. If an initial proficiency check fails, the mount resists moving faster than normal. Otherwise, the mount begins to move up to 2d6 feet per round beyond its normal rate. Proficiency checks must be made every five rounds. So long as the checks succeed, the mount continues to move at the faster rate for up to two turns. After the mount moves at this accelerated rate for two turns, its rate then drops to 2/3 of its normal rate. It can move no faster than 2/3 of its normal rate until allowed to rest for a full hour.
If the second or any subsequent check fails, the mount's movement drops to half its normal rate. It continues to move at this half-speed rate until allowed to rest for an hour.
* If a sea-based mount on the surface of the water is attacked, it will normally submerge unless it makes a successful morale roll. If the morale roll fails, the rider can command the mount to re-surface by making a successful proficiency check. If the check fails, the rider can attempt another check each round thereafter, so long as he is physically able. While submerged with the mount and attempting to force it to surface, the rider risks drowning (see Chapter 14 of the Player's Handbook). Because he's exerting himself, the number of rounds the rider can hold his breath is equal to half his Constitution score.
2 Rope Use
This proficiency enables a character to accomplish amazing feats with rope. A character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or loosen with a quick tug. If the character's hands are bound and held with a knot, he can roll a proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to escape the bonds.
This character gains a +2 bonus to all attacks made with a lasso. The character also receives a +10% bonus to all climbing checks made while he is using a rope, including attempts to belay (secure the end of a climbing rope) companions.
2 Rowing
No description
2 Running
The character can move at twice his normal movement rate for a day. At the end of the day he must sleep for eight hours. After the first day's movement, the character must roll a proficiency check for success. If the die roll succeeds, the character can continue his running movement the next day. If the die roll fails, the character cannot use his running ability the next day. If involved in a battle during a day he spent running, he suffers a -1 penalty to his attack rolls.
2 Sage Knowledge
This proficiency represents a specialized area of knowledge or learning. A character with this skill is a fully qualified sage in the area of study chosen and is capable of answering questions concerning the topic after some time spent researching. Refer to Table 62: Sage Modifiers and Table 63: Research Times in the DMG. As noted in the DMG, a sage requires an excellent library as a resource—at least 50 to 100 books, costing no less than 10,000 gp altogether. Naturally, a character may be able to strike a deal with a university, monastery, or wizards’ guild hall in order to gain access to their library.
In addition to his ability to perform sage research, the character’s high level of learning allows him to make field observations or attempt to come up with knowledge off the top of his head. For example, a sage who studies botany may attempt a proficiency check in order to identify a particular plant, while one who studies toxicology may be able to identify a poison by its symptoms in a victim. These on the spot observations should be limited to information any expert could reasonably come up with in the field— identifying a common gemstone is one thing for a geologist, but making a guess about the electrical conductivity of quartz crystal or the enchantments of a magical gem is a different matter entirely.
Purchasing this proficiency at its base cost (2 slots or 5 character points) gives the sage a broad overview of the area of study in question, allowing him to answer general or specific questions in the field. For an additional proficiency slot (or 2 CPs), the character may become an expert in one particular aspect of the topic. For example, a botanist may spend another slot to specialize in moss and lichens, ferns, or all plants found in a particular climate or ecosystem. This detailed knowledge allows the character to attempt to answer exacting questions in the field. The fields of study available to a sage include:
* Alchemy: This is the study of magical chemistry, especially as it applies to elemental transmutations and potions, oils, and magical compounds or solvents. Unlike the proficiency of alchemy, the sage knowledge of alchemy concentrates on theories and principals, not on the practical day to day manufacture of specific compounds and substances. An alchemist specialist wizard or a character with the alchemy proficiency gains a +2 bonus to his proficiency rating in this area of sage knowledge.
* Architecture: This is the study of the development, theories and styles of architecture. (The architecture proficiency, on the other hand, represents the practical execution of workable building plans.) A sage with this field of study can attempt to identify the age, origins, and general purpose of ruined buildings or structures.
* Art: The sage is familiar with the great works of the past as well as the works of the best contemporary artists. If he specializes in one particular art form (sculpture, paintings, ornamental pottery, etc.) he is able to identify works of the masters, spot fakes, and appraise pieces for sale value.
* Astrology: This is the history and theoretical background of astrology, not the actual art of prediction. Someone with the astrology proficiency knows that Planet X passing in front of Constellation Y means trouble, but a sage knows why that’s a sign of ill fortune. In addition, the sage has the ability to perform historical astrology by working backwards to determine the stars’ and planet’s alignments for thousands of years in the past. An expert in this field may be familiar with the constellations and beliefs of vanished or dead cultures.
* Astronomy: For the astrologer, planets and constellations are representations of greater powers. The astronomer, on the other hand, assigns no characteristics or indications to these heavenly bodies, and instead concentrates on studying their movements in the skies. He can predict eclipses, anticipate the return of comets or meteor showers, and answer questions about the locations or predicted locations of various planets or other bodies in the skies.
* Botany: This is the study of plants, ranging from simple cataloguing and observation to detailed studies of life cycles and ecologies. Areas of specialization include simple plants, water plants, grasses and brush, flowering plants, domesticated plants, plant diseases, and ecological systems such as rain forest, tundra, prairie, etc.
* Cartography: Cartography is the art of map making. A sage who specializes in this field knows where to find maps for any given region or area, knows how to interpret maps using various forms of notation, and can attempt to solve or complete encrypted or partial maps.
* Chemistry: While alchemy focuses on the study of magical substances, chemistry concentrates on the study of the properties of mundane substances. Note that a character with the alchemy proficiency is assumed to use a fair amount of mundane chemistry to produce acids, solvents, and pyrotechnic substances.
* Cryptography: This is the study of codes, ciphers, and puzzles. A sage with skill in cryptography can attempt to break codes or solve written puzzles with time and study.
* Engineering: The character is familiar with the science of building devices, engines, and structures. Sage knowledge of engineering provides a +2 bonus to the character’s nonweapon proficiency score in engineering, if he has both proficiencies. The character can specialize in small machines, large machines (water wheels, etc.), siege engineering, fortifications, bridges and roads, or buildings.
* Folklore: The sage studies legends and folk tales. By spending another proficiency slot, he can specialize in the folklore of a particular culture or region.
* Genealogy: This is the study of lines of descent. A sage with this skill knows research techniques and sources for tracing family trees and is also familiar with the histories of the important royal and noble families.
* Geography: A sage with this knowledge has learned about the lands and cultures of his world. He knows general principles of cartography, topography, climatology, and sociology, and can identify individuals or artifacts from other lands.
* Geology: Geology is the study of landforms, rock, and the physical makeup of the earth. A sage with knowledge in this area can add a +2 bonus to his rating in the mining nonweapon proficiency and can attempt a proficiency check to identify various sorts of gemstones or precious minerals.
* Heraldry: Coats of arms, banners, flags, and standards are all emblazoned with heraldic designs. A sage with this skill is familiar with the evolution of heraldry and the significance of various symbols and colors. He can identify common coats of arms on sight and knows where to research obscure or unknown devices. This area of knowledge adds a +2 bonus to a character’s heraldry nonweapon proficiency score.
* History: A sage with this skill has an excellent grasp of history and the historical methods. Unlike a character with the ancient or local history proficiencies, a sage with this skill is a generalist, but he can be considered an expert on a particular era or culture by spending an additional slot to specialize. Whether or not the historian knows something off the top of his head doesn’t matter—he knows exactly where to look when he needs to find out the details of a person’s life or an important event. Skill in this field of knowledge provides a +2 bonus to the character’s proficiency score in ancient history or local history.
* Languages: A character with a modern language proficiency knows how to speak a second language, and a character with an ancient languages proficiency knows how to read a second language, but a sage who specializes in languages is concerned with the study of the language itself—grammar, syntax and constructs, and vocabulary and word origin. His expertise is limited to one particular tongue, but for each additional slot the linguist may add another language to his field of expertise. This knowledge adds a +2 bonus to the linguist’s rating in any modern or ancient language proficiencies he possesses.
* Law: A sage with this field of study is an expert on matters of law. He is familiar with any national constitutions or charters, the origin and history of the law, and important matters of precedent. He can examine contracts, warrants, orders, or decrees and determine if there is a way to enforce or avoid them.
* Mathematics: The study of abstract or theoretical mathematics may seem unusual in a fantasy setting, but it dates back thousands of years in our own world; the ancient Greeks laid the groundwork for geometry, while algebra was a pastime of Islamic scholars and nobles before the European Renaissance. A dimensionalist gains a +2 bonus on his proficiency rating in this area of study.
* Medicine: A sage with this skill studies both the history and development of medicine, as well as current methods and treatments. This provides the character with a +2 bonus to his healing nonweapon proficiency score. In addition, the character may be able to come up with treatments for nonmagical diseases or injuries.
* Meteorology: This is the study of weather and weather patterns. A sage with this skill knows historical records and prediction methods. In the field, his knowledge of weather provides a +2 bonus to any weather sense proficiency checks he makes.
* Music: The sage knows the theory and notation systems of music and has studied the works of the great masters. He can attempt to identify unknown pieces or decipher musical puzzles.
* Myconology: Myconology is the study of fungi. A myconologist can identify samples of fungus, mold, or spores. He is familiar with dangerous or monstrous varieties as well and may be able to spot these in the wild before he or his companions come to harm. His knowledge of mushrooms and molds gives him a +2 bonus to herbalism nonweapon proficiency checks.
* Oceanography: A sage with this skill studies the ocean, including weather, marine biology, navigation and charting, and undersea topography. An oceanographer may be able to explain unusual phenomena at sea or discover the location of wrecks or other sites of interest.
* Philosophy: The study of philosophy is the study of logic, ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics (for game purposes, anyway), and a sage with expertise in this field is conversant with the great thinkers and arguments of his race or culture.
* Physics: In most AD&amp;D campaigns, the study of physics centers around mechanics and thermodynamics; some of the more advanced fields of study simply haven’t been invented yet.
* Planes, Inner: Most individuals in a campaign have little to no knowledge of worlds beyond the one in which they live, but a sage with expertise in this field is familiar with the characteristics and properties of the Ethereal Plane and the various Elemental Planes beyond that. He understands how the Inner Planes are aligned and how the multiverse is put together. If he spends an additional slot to specialize, he can be an expert on a particular plane, capable of answering exacting questions on the topic.
* Planes, Outer: The great religions of a campaign tend to disseminate a very limited view of the multiverse, centering on the home of their deity and that of their deity’s principal foes. A sage who studies this field has a general understanding with the general arrangement of all the Outer Planes and the characteristics of the Astral Plane. For an additional slot, he can specialize in a particular plane, learning the general properties of its layers, its chief inhabitants and domains, and other important details.
* School of Magic: A sage with expertise in a school of magic is familiar with the important theories, works, and great mages of that field. By engaging in research and passing a proficiency check, the sage could identify spells or magical items belonging to the school by the item’s general effects or appearance. For example, if he was a student of the school of force, he could identify a wand of force or beads of force as if he were trying to answer a specific question. If the sage is also a wizard, he gains a +5% bonus to his chance to learn spells from the school in question. A specialist wizard gains a +2 to his score in this proficiency if the school of magic is his own specialty.
* Sociology: This is the study of social structures, customs, mores, and ways of life. The sage is also acquainted with past societies and their customs.
* Theology: A sage with expertise in this area is conversant with the tenets and beliefs of most major religions, gaining a +2 bonus to his religion nonweapon proficiency check. In addition, he studies the theories and lore surrounding the powers and boundaries of the gods themselves. With research, a theologist can determine what a particular god might or might not be capable of doing.
* Toxicology: This is the study of poisons, both natural and artificial. A sage with expertise in toxicology can identify poisons both from samples and from examining the symptoms of a poisoned victim. By using toxicology, a sage can also gain a +1 to any healing proficiency check dealing with poisons.
* Zoology: Zoology is the study of animals. A sage who acquires knowledge in this area has a good overall grasp of the science of zoology, and in addition, he is considered a specialist in one general class of animals or monsters. Each additional slot he spends on this proficiency adds one more type or class to his expertise. Classes of animals available include birds, reptiles, mammals, fish, amphibians, insects, amorphous monsters (slimes, jellies, and molds), aquatic monsters, insectile monsters, reptilian monsters, mammalian monsters, hybrid monsters (griffins, perytons, etc.), and any other reasonable class or grouping the DM allows. A zoologist can identify common species in the field with a successful proficiency check and may be able to predict behavior or capabilities based on his knowledge of the creature in question.
2 Scribe
Before printing came into common use, professional scribes created books by copying manuscripts. Even after printing presses were in widespread use, scribes were in demand for their calligraphy and the quality of their illuminated (or illustrated) pages. A character with this proficiency is familiar with a scribe’s techniques for preparing pages and working both swiftly and accurately. This is an invaluable skill for a wizard; with a successful proficiency check, the character gains a +5% bonus to any rolls he must make in order to copy or transcribe a spell into his spell book or onto a scroll.
2 Sculpting
The character with this proficiency can render realistic objects out of stone and clay. A high level of sculpting proficiency, coupled with the artistic talent trait, means the character can create statues, statuettes, busts, and other objects of rare and valuable beauty.
2 Seamanship
The character is familiar with boats and ships. He is qualified to work as a crewman, although he cannot actually navigate. Crews of trained seamen are necessary to manage any ship, and they improve the movement rates of inland boats by 50 percent.
2 Seamstress/Tailor
The character can sew and design clothing. He can also do all kinds of embroidery and ornamental work. Although no proficiency check is required, the character must have at least needle and thread to work.
2 Sense Danger
This skill allows warriors or rogues to discover threats that are not obvious to less perceptive characters.
The sense danger skill is actually five different subskills, as outlined below. The number of subskills the warrior knows depends on the character’s level: one subskill at 15th–19th level, two at 20th–24th level, three at 25th–29th level, and four subskills at 30th level or higher. If the character purchases this skill twice, the warrior gains one extra subskill. Any improvement to the skill number improves all the subskills the character knows.
Each subskill gives the warrior the ability to detect danger in a different form:
* Ambushes: The warrior or rogue can determine if hidden enemies are lurking in any area the character can see well (see Table 62 in the Player’s Handbook). The warrior can scan an area roughly 200 yards square in a single round. An area can be scanned only once each turn, and a successful check reveals approximately how many creatures are hiding in the area and their approximate size.
<ul>
<li>Warrior:
<ul>
<li>
Attack Readiness: With a successful skill check, the warrior can tell if a creature is prepared to attack. The skill does not tell the anything about the other being’s actual intentions, just its readiness for combat. For example, a creature that is prepared for combat might attack soon, or it might simply be ready to respond to a hostile action. In one round, the warrior can determine the battle readiness of every being in a 30 foot cube.
The warrior can also study a single creature to determine if it has any concealed weapons. A successful check reveals any hidden weapons (tucked into clothing, hidden nearby, etc). If faced with an unknown creature, a successful skill check allows the warrior to determine what its attack modes are (claws, teeth, etc.).
When the warrior detects a concealed weapon with this skill, the character notes its general size, location, and type—a sap tucked into the back of a character’s breeches or a dagger hidden in a sleeve, for example. The character learns nothing else about the weapon. Note that the warrior must be aware of the creature before checking for concealed weapons. The warrior cannot detect weapons hidden by illusions or other magical means.
</li>
<li>
Back Attacks: When an enemy launches an attack at the warrior from the rear, the character can attempt a skill check to detect the assault. Success negates any chance for surprise and all special bonuses the attacker might gain from a rear attack, including a thief’s backstab bonuses. A successful check allows the warrior to apply defensive bonuses from a high Dexterity/Balance score, even if the character does not turn to meet the attack. Shield bonuses are not applicable unless the character turns around. Unlike the barbarian’s back protection ability (see The Complete Barbarian’s Handbook, Chapter 1), this skill does not allow the warrior to make a free counterattack.
</li>
<li>
Hidden Enemies: The warrior has a sixth sense about hidden enemies in the immediate vicinity. Once a round, the character can make a skill check. If successful, the warrior learns the location of all invisible, ethereal, astral, out of phase, or hidden creatures within a 30 foot radius. The character does not know how the creature’s are hidden—an ethereal creature is indistinguishable from an invisible one—but the character notes their locations and can track their movements so long as they remain within the radius. The warrior suffers a +1 initiative penalty on the round when he uses this ability.
This subskill does not reveal disguised creatures in plain sight or the intentions of creatures. For example, a golem posing as a statue is not revealed, nor can the character determine if an NPC is secretly hostile.
</li>
<li>
Size Up Opponent: With a successful skill check, the warrior can study a single creature each round and determine how dangerous the creature would be in physical combat. It does not give the warrior any indication of a creature’s magical abilities, innate spell like powers, breath weapons, and the like. If a creature’s hit points and THAC0 qualify it for more than one category, the DM is free to choose which one the warrior detects.
<ul>
* Low: The creature’s hit point total is 20% or less than the warrior’s, and its THAC0 is at least 15 points higher.
* Moderate: The creature has 21–50% of the warrior’s hit points or its THAC0 is at least 10 points higher.
* Significant: The creature has 51–70% of the warrior’s hit points, and its THAC0 is at least 5 points higher.
* Dangerous: The creature has 71–100% of the warrior’s hit points, and its THAC0 is less than 5 points higher, but not lower.
* Deadly: The creature has more hit points and a lower THAC0 than the warrior.
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rogue:
<ul>
<li>
Concealed Weapons: The rogue can study a creature to determine if it has any concealed weapons. A successful check reveals any weapons hidden about the creature’s person (tucked into clothing, hidden nearby, etc). If faced with an unknown creature, a successful skill check allows the rogue to determine what its attack modes are (claws, teeth, etc.).
When the rogue detects a concealed weapon with this skill, the character notes its general size, location, and type—a sap tucked into the back of a character’s breeches or a dagger hidden in a sleeve, for example. The character learns nothing else about the weapon. Note that the rogue must be aware of the creature before checking for concealed weapons—a rogue cannot attempt to search a statue for concealed weapons because the player suspects it might be a golem. Unlike the warrior’s version of this skill, a rogue can detect magically concealed weapons.
</li>
<li>
Hostile Intentions: A rogue can size up a living creature in plain sight and deduce its level of hostility toward the rogue and his party. A successful roll gives the rogue a general level of hostility: low (a suspicious merchant), medium (a thief from an opposing guild), or high (caught by the local wizard with his staff of the magi in your backpack). Unlike the warrior ability, the rogue skill does not reveal how well prepared for attack the creature is, just how much it would like to attack. This skill does not indicate how likely a creature is to attack, since a creature does not always act on its hostility.
</li>
<li>
Impending Attacks: The rogue develops a sixth sense about weapons and other forms of attack aimed at the character. Any time an undetected enemy is preparing an attack, the rogue can attempt a skill check to receive a vague impression about the attacker’s general direction (front, rear, left, right) and distance (close, far). In many cases, the attacker’s identity is obvious from the information the skill provides. A successful skill check gives the rogue a +2 bonus on surprise rolls and a +1 bonus to the initiative roll during the first round of combat if the character is not surprised. Unlike the warrior back protection subskill, the rogue must turn to face the attacker to negate any applicable rear attack bonuses. If the character is surprised in spite of this skill, the attacker receives all bonuses normally applied to rear attacks, including backstab adjustments.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
With any subskill, the DM should roll the check secretly. If the roll fails on a roll of 19 or less, the character detects nothing. If the roll fails on a 20, the character gets a false indication—sensing an invisible figure where there is none, improperly sizing up an opponent, etc. A false indication has no effect on a back attack.
If the character also has the alertness proficiency, the character receives a +1 bonus to his skill score.
2 Set Snares
The character can make simple snares and traps, primarily to catch small game. These can include rope snares and spring traps. A proficiency check must be rolled when the snare is first constructed and every time the snare is set. A failed proficiency check means the trap does not work for some reason. It may be that the workmanship was bad, the character left too much scent in the area, or he poorly concealed the finished work. The exact nature of the problem does not need to be known. The character can also attempt to set traps and snares for larger creatures: tiger pits and net snares, for example. A proficiency check must be rolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the ability score. In both cases, setting a successful snare does not ensure that it catches anything, only that the snare works if triggered. The DM must decide if the trap is triggered.
Thief characters (and only thieves) with this proficiency can also attempt to rig man-traps. These can involve such things as crossbows, deadfalls, spiked springboards, etc. The procedure is the same as that for setting a large snare. The DM must determine the amount of damage caused by a man-trap.
Setting a small snare or trap takes one hour of work. Setting a larger trap requires two to three people (only one need have the proficiency) and 2d4 hours of work. Setting a man-trap requires one or more people (depending on its nature) and 1d8 hours of work. To prepare any trap, the character must have appropriate materials on hand.
Characters with animal lore proficiency gain a +2 bonus to their ability score when attempting to set a snare for the purposes of catching game. Their knowledge of animals and the woods serves them well for this purpose. They gain no benefit when attempting to trap monsters or intelligent beings.
2 Shadow Flight*
|* Amount of Shadow|Rate/Maneuverability
|- None|Normal*
|- Weak|15/D
|- Strong|18/C
|- Very|24/B**
This ability is similar to the shadow travel skill, except that a successful hide in shadows roll allows the character to fly silently from shadow to shadow.
Like the shadow travel skill, the rogue must begin with a successful hide in shadows roll. Once in the shadows, the character’s movement rate and maneuverability class depend on the strength of the shadows:
* Flight is not possible.
* Once an hour, the rogue can instantly move up to 360 yards, as a dimension door spell, as long as the destination is at least as shadowy as the rogue’s current position.
While flying or traveling instantaneously, the rogue can be no more than lightly encumbered. The rogue can carry other creatures if their weight does not exceed the rogue’s light encumbrance limit.
2 Shadow Travel
|* Amount of Shadow|Movement Rate
|- No Shadows|Normal
|- Weak Shadows|15
|- Strong Shadow|18
|- Very Shadowy|24
This skill allows a rogue to move rapidly from one shadowy area to another, moving at seemingly blinding speed.
The use this skill, the rogue must first successfully hide in shadows, which is required to use this skill. After entering the area of shadow, the rogue can move into other shadows at increased speeds. The actual movement depends on the amount of shadow available, according to the table below.
* No Shadows: The rogue is surrounded by multiple light sources, within a magical light or darkness spell, or in the open on a bright, clear day.
* Weak Shadows: Outdoors at dawn or twilight, in a woods on a bright day, average indoor light, or outdoors on a moonless or overcast night are examples of these conditions.
* Strong Shadows: The rogue is outdoors at night or in dim indoor light.
* Very Shadowy: Most areas of near darkness apply for this condition, including: in woods at twilight; in a windowless room with a single, flickering light source such as a torch, candle, or fire; outdoors at night along the edges of the circle of light thrown by an artificial light source (Player’s Handbook, Table 63).
The rogue is visible when moving between shadows, but he remains hidden while within the shadows and able to move at an accelerated rate until the character attacks or the shadows get weaker. If the rogue leaves the shadows to attack, the character can enter them again and resume accelerated movement on any round when the rogue does not attack and there are shadows available. Shadow movement is not silent, but the rogue can attempt a move silently roll while moving through shadows and still move at the accelerated rate. Accelerated movement is subject to normal modifiers for terrain and encumbrance.

2 Shipwright
This character is knowledgable regarding techniques for ship construction and repair. He car design and build ships or all types, with a proficiency check being required for unusual features only. The character can perform routine maintenance on spalljamming vessels, including repairing sails and caulking the hull, without a proficiency check. A shipwright need not have other workmen to finish small vessels, but larger vessels require cews of shipwrights and other laborers to build or repair.
A character with the shipwright proficiency is considered a "trained worker" for the purpose of ship repair. This proficiency is relevant for ship repairs of all types.
2 Sign Language
A character with this proficiency can cimmunicate with hand movements instead of speech.  Sign language can convey messages of the same complexity and nuance as a spoken language, providing the participants can see each other's hands.
If two characters with this proficiency wish to communicate, both must make proficiency checks.  If both succeed, they may use sign language to silently converse for a full round.  They may continue their conversation by making successful checks on subsequent rounds.  During a round when either character fails his check, the communication is garbled; the sender's finger movements weren't percise, the reciever wasn't paying attention, or something blocked the line of sight.  On a natuel roll of 20, the reciever interprets the message as the opposite of what the sender intended.
A character with this poficiency may also try to convey a simple message to a character without the proficiency.  The player must first whisper the phrase to the DM, who decides if the phrase is acceptable.  Acceptable phrases incluse "Don't move," "Follow me," and "I'm hurt."  Complicated phrases or those containing proper nouns are unacceptable, such as "My name is Grog," "Take three steps north, then look up," and "We can find the antidote in Elk Valley."  If the DM deems the phrase unacceptable, sign language can't be attempted; no proficiency check is nessecary.  If the DM allows the phrase, the character makes a check.
The maximum range is usually line of sight in a lit area, or the extent of the receiver's infravision.
A +2 bonus should only be used when giving short, easily recognized commands. More detailed signals require a -1 modifier. If the check succeeds, the phrase is successfully communicated.  If the check fails, the phrase is garbled.  On a natural roll of 20, the reciever misunderstands the phrase, interpreting it as the oppisite of its actual meaning.  A character can't attempt to communicate the same phrase more than once to the same recipient.
2 Signalling
This proficiency gives the character the ability to send messages over long distances. The character must designate his preferred method for signaling. Typical methods include smoke signals, whistling, waving flags, drums, or reflecting mirrors. For each additional slot spent, the character may choose an additional method.
Because signaling is essentially a language, messages of reasonable complexity can be communicated. A practiced signaller can transmit as many as 10 words per combat round.
To interpret the signal, the recipient must be able to see or hear it. He must also have the signaling proficiency and know the same signaling method as the sender. To send a message and have it understood, both the signaler and the recipient must make successful proficiency checks. If one fails his roll, the message is distorted; the message can be sent again in the following round, and proficiency checks may be attempted again. If both checks fail, or if either character rolls a natural 20, an incorrect message was sent and received; the message has the opposite of the intended meaning. Characters without the signaling proficiency, as well as characters who have the proficiency but use a different signaling method, can't understand the signals.
2 Signalling, Underground
The underground signalling proficiency allows a character to send messages underground using sound. To send a signal, tap on a section of wall with a rock, hammer, or a piece of metal. The sound will echo through rock to a distance of 1d4 miles. The sound transmitted by this proficiency resembles morse code and it may be used to send extensive messages or short commands and instructions. To send a message, roll a proficiency check. If successful, the message transmits as desired. If not, the message may be only partially understood or complete nonsense. It may even convey a meaning contrary to the message sent. Successful transmission of a message is no guarantee that it will be understood by the receiving end and proficiency checks are required to correctly interpret the message. It is possible to fail to understand an incorrectly sent signal, yet still infer a message from it, one very different from what was intended.
2 Signature Item
A warrior with this skill chooses an item from the character’s collection of equipment as a personal trademark that is specially protected from twists of fate.
The warrior designates a signature item by giving it a name and noting something distinctive about it. If the item has no distinguishing features, the character must hire an artisan with the appropriate skill—such as a weaponsmith for a sword—to add one. The alteration could be as simple as engraving the item’s name somewhere upon its surface or as elaborate as the character desires (and can afford). No skill check is required to designate an item, and as soon as the item is designated, described, and named, the warrior forms an empathic link with it. It is possible to have more than one signature item, but the character must pay the full cost of this skill for each item. If the warrior improves the skill score, the improvement applies to all the character’s signature equipment.
A signature item must be something the character has owned for an extended period of time and uses regularly. For example, a warrior cannot designate a friendly wizard’s favorite spell book as a signature item. The DM is free to decide how long the character must own the item, but one level’s worth of advancement is the usual period. Likewise, the DM must decide what constitutes regular use, but at least once during the majority of the character’s adventures is the usual requirement. Only nonconsumable items can be signature items, but rechargeable items qualify.
If a signature item is ever required to roll an item saving throw (see the Dungeon Master Guide, Chapter 6), it automatically succeeds so long as the owner is carrying the item and the survives the event. For example, if Tana is subjected to a fireball and fails her saving throw vs. spell, all her equipment must save vs. magical fire or be destroyed. Tana’s signature sword, Windsinger, does not have to roll the item saving throw, it succeeds automatically.
Deliberate actions that lead to item saving throws can destroy a signature item. For example, if Tana uses Windsinger as a brace to keep a trap from closing, the sword can break. Likewise, if an attacker deliberately targets a disintegrate spell at Windsinger, the sword can also be destroyed. Deliberate actions can destroy a signature item even if the owner is not aware of the danger. For example, if Tana slashes at what she thinks is a giant spider, but the creature is really a rust monster, Windsinger could be destroyed.
If the character does not survive the event that caused the item saving throw, the item must make the roll normally. If the item survives the incident and the character is restored to life, the link is automatically reestablished. If the item is destroyed in the same event that killed the warrior, the link is broken.
If a signature item is ever lost or stolen, the link with the item allows the warrior to attempt a skill check once a day to receive a vision of the item’s location. If successful, the character receives a visual image of the item’s current surroundings and has a vague idea of the location’s distance and direction. If the item lies on another plane, the warrior receives a vision of the plane, but can discern no other information unless he actually travels to the plane. If the item is magically hidden, the warrior learns this fact, along with the item’s general location. For example, he would know that his signature item is hidden in King Snurre’s great hall.
If a signature item is destroyed or irrecoverable, the character can use the link to obtain a replacement. This does not apply if both the signature item and the character were destroyed by the same event. If the signature item was nonmagical, the character need only acquire a similar item and give it the same name as the original. The character forms a link with the new item, which gradually begins to resemble the original until it becomes indistinguishable from the original after about one month.
If the item was magical, the character must obtain an item of quality (see the Dungeon Master Guide, Chapter 6) and roll a skill check. If the check succeeds, the link is strong enough to recreate the item. The character loses five times the item’s experience point value and the nonmagical item is miraculously infused with an enchantment that exactly matches the original item after about one month. If the character is unwilling to pay the experience cost, the link is broken instead. If a magical item similar to the original item is used instead of an item of quality, its experience value is subtracted from warrior’s experience loss. Artifacts cannot be restored in this manner, though the character gains the other benefits of the link.
Voluntarily giving away or not making a reasonable effort to recover a signature item that has been lost or stolen always breaks the link. The DM is the final judge of what constitutes a reasonable effort at recovery.
Warriors can have one signature item from each of the following categories: armor, weapon, shield, and miscellaneous magical item. Each signature item requires the expenditure of the appropriate number of proficiency slots or character points. At the DM’s option, pairs of magical items might also qualify as a single signature item, such as the twin blades of Ra.
A wizard with this skill chooses an item from the character’s collection of equipment as a personal trademark that is specially protected from twists of fate, except as noted below.
The wizard is free to have as many signature items as he is willing to pay for, but no more than one of any type of item is allowed. For example, the wizard could not have two staffs of the magi as signature items, but he could have a staff of the magi, wand of magic missiles, and a rod of smiting as signature items.
The wizard can choose items from the ring, rod, staff, wand, miscellaneous magic, and weapon categories.
2 Signature Mount
A warrior with this skill forms a special bond with a mount. When they are together, the mount gains considerable protection from attacks that might otherwise kill it.
A signature mount cannot have more than 10 Hit Dice and must have at least four hit points per Hit Die. For example, a heavy war horse has 5+5 hit dice; it cannot become a signature mount unless it has at least 25 hit points. The mount must be tamed and recognize the warrior as its master. If the creature has an Intelligence score of 5 or more, it need not be trained if it willingly serves the warrior. The warrior must name the mount and provide it with something that makes it recognizable. This can be as simple as purchasing a saddle with the mount’s name engraved in it or as elaborate as the character can afford.
When the link is established, the mount immediately gains one hit point per level of the character plus an additional hit point each time the warrior gains a level. When the warrior is riding the mount, the mount suffers no damage from area attacks (such as breath weapons and fireballs) if the rider successfully saves against the attack. If the rider fails the saving throw but survives the attack, the mount saves for half or no damage, using the rider’s saving throw number. The mount also gains the rider’s saving throw against effects targeted directly at it (such as disintegrate and the cold ray form of Otiluke’s freezing sphere) as long as the rider is with the mount. Attacks such as power word spells must be potent enough to overcome the rider to have any effect, although they affect only the mount if that is where they are targeted. If the mount is alone, or the rider does not survive the attack, the mount must use its own saving throw number, and it suffers the normal effects from the attack.
If a signature mount is ever killed, the warrior can acquire a new one of the same type and hit points. Each day, the character can attempt a skill check to receive a vision of the new mount. If the check succeeds, the character sees the mount in its current surroundings and knows the approximate direction and distance to the location. If the mount is on another plane, the warrior receives a vision of the plane but can discern no other information unless the character actually travels to the plane. If the mount is magically hidden, the warrior learns this fact, along with the mount’s general location. It is up to the character to seek out the replacement mount, but the mount willingly serves the warrior if the character obtains it.
A warrior can have one signature mount for each different type of terrain. For example, the character might have a young adult mercury dragon (airborne), heavy war horse (land), and a giant sea horse (water). Subterranean and desert mounts might also be allowed, at the DM’s option. Each signature mount requires the expenditure of the appropriate number of proficiency slots or skill points.

2 Singing
The character is an accomplished singer and can use this ability to entertain others and perhaps earn a small living (note that bards can do this automatically). No proficiency check is required to sing. The character can also create choral works on a successful proficiency check.
2 Slow Respiration
A character with this proficiency has the ability to enter a deep trance and reduce the amount of air he needs to stay alive. To induce the trance, he must be in a restful position, either sitting or lying down. After concentrating for one turn, pulse and breathing drop well below normal, so that breathing requires only 10% of the rate when resting. The character emerges from his trance at will, fully aware of anything that has occurred nearby.
2 Smelting
The smelting proficiency is closely tied to the Mining proficiency. Between them they provide all of the metal to the strongholds. With this proficiency a smelter can be operated.
2 Smite*
|* Priest Level|Cone Length
|- 18–20|30'
|- 21–23|50'
|- 24–26|70'
|- 27–29|90'
|- 30|110'
A priest with this skill is empowered to direct a wave of destruction at beings who have wronged the priest or offended the priest’s deity.
When the priest uses this power, a cone of divine force issues from the priest’s body in any direction the character wishes. The cone is 5' in diameter at the priest’s body and 30' in diameter at the far end. Its maximum length depends on the priest’s level as shown below:
The priest has no control over the precise effect of the smiting, which the DM chooses from the list below. No matter what the effect, only the priest’s enemies are harmed. Allies, innocent bystanders, and worshippers in good standing with the priest’s deity are not affected.
<ul>
<li>
Awestruck: This is the default effect when the deity does not feel the targets are offensive or threatening. It also is granted when the deity feels that a simple demonstration of its power is sufficient to handle the situation.
A two dimensional depiction of the deity or the deity’s symbol appears in front of the priest, causing the priest’s enemies to stare at it in awe if they are within the cone. Creatures with more than 10 Hit Dice or levels are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Even if the save succeeds, creatures are awestruck for one round, regardless of personal immunities granted by spell or high ability scores.
Creatures remain awestruck only as long as the priest remains motionless and concentrates on the effect, but no longer than one round per level of the priest, plus 1d8 rounds, in any case. Enemies who enter the cone after the image appears are fully subject to the awe effect, even if they avert their eyes. Any motion or the slightest break in the priest’s concentration ends the effect, as does any offensive action by the priest’s allies. Distractions to the awestruck characters also end the effect. Loud noises, magical displays, attacks, or attempts to steal the awestruck creatures’ equipment, damage their property, or otherwise cause them harm are sufficient to break the effect.
</li>
<li>
Blinded: Deities grant this effect when they find the target creatures offensive, but not particularly dangerous.
Only creatures with 12 or more levels or Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid the effect.
Blinded creatures move at 2/3 the normal rate and suffer a –4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, initiative rolls, and ability checks. Blinded spellcasters cannot cast spells unless they can touch their targets. Blindness lasts until the victim receives a heal or cure blindness or deafness spell.
</li>
<li>
Burned: This effect is granted when the targets are violent and pose an immediate physical threat to the priest, a sacred site, or to creatures friendly toward the priest. The cone fills with a mass of heatless flames that burn the priest’s enemies for 6d8 points of damage, save vs. breath weapon for half. Creatures killed by the flames are reduced to piles of ash and no regeneration is possible. Though the heatless flames do not harm the area, they can affect the target’s equipment. If a target creature fails the breath weapon saving throw or is killed by the flames, any equipment the creature carries must save vs. disintegration or be reduced to dust.
</li>
<li>
Deafened: This effect occurs when the targets have not greatly offended the deity or when the priest is not in significant peril. Only creatures with 12 or more levels or Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. breath weapon to avoid the effect.
Deafened creatures move at 3/4 the normal rate and suffer a –2 penalty to attack rolls, initiative rolls, and ability checks. There is a 50% chance that any spell a deafened spellcaster attempts fails outright. Deafness lasts until the victim receives a heal or cure blindness or deafness spell.
</li>
<li>
Death: Deities grant this effect only when deeply offended or when the priest is in extreme danger. Enemies within the cone are immediately reduced to dust if they have 4 Hit Dice/levels or less. Other enemies suffer a doubled burning effect (12d8 points of damage, save vs. spells for half damage).
</li>
<li>
Immobilized: Deities commonly grant this effect when the targets are genuinely dangerous or offensive. Creatures of 6+1 Hit Dice/levels or less are automatically paralyzed, their flesh turning into a rigid, crystalline substance that is easily shattered. Other creatures are allowed a save vs. petrification to negate the effect. The immobility lasts 1d4+2 turns. Free action is useless against this effect.
Immobilized creatures can be killed by striking their crystalline bodies with any hard object. For each strike, the creature must make a saving throw as rock crystal versus crushing blow. Only bonuses granted from magical rings, cloaks, and armor count toward the saving throw. Failure results in death.
</li>
<li>
Plagued: The deity grants this effect when the targets are offensive, but do not pose any danger to the deity’s interests. The priest’s enemies are affected as if struck by a cause disease spell. The disease inflicted is debilitating (see the reversed form of the 3rd level priest spell cure disease) and causes the victim to radiate a foul stench. The disease is neither contagious nor fatal. It can be cured by a cure disease or breath of life spell from a caster of higher level that the priest who called down the plague.
</li>
<li>
Slowed: This effect is granted when deity is offended, but the enemies pose no immediate threat to a sacred site, the priest, or creatures friendly toward the priest or the deity. The effect is the same as the 3rd level wizard spell slow, except that creatures with less than 8+1 Hit Dice or levels get no saving throw. The slow effect lasts for 1d4+2 turns.
</li>
</ul>
Each use of this ability reduces the base score for the priest’s eminence skill by two for one week. As long the priest has a positive eminence score, the priest need not make a skill roll to smite enemies. If the priest’s base eminence skill score is zero or less, however, the priest must roll an eminence check to successfully smite enemies. Note that this is possible only if the priest has a Charisma/Leadership bonus large enough to offset a negative base score. If the roll fails, the deity is displeased. At best, no smite effect occurs, at worst, the deity directs a smite effect upon the priest.
An example: Marissa has an eminence score of 4 and a Charisma/Leadership bonus of +4. She can freely smite enemies twice a week as long as her eminence base score is not reduced by using other skills. During an adventure, she uses her smite skill once and the divine voice skill once. This reduces her eminence skill to zero. If she wishes to use her smite skill again, she must roll a 4 or less on 1d20 to succeed.
Undaunted, Marissa smites a group of passing kobolds she has come upon. Her 1d20 roll is a 3, so the smite works. Marissa’s deity isn’t too worried about the kobolds, who were minding their own business when Marissa came along, and grants Marissa an awe effect. The kobolds are briefly entranced, but a fighter from Marissa’s party wades into the kobolds, making an all round attack. The attack breaks the awe effect.
Feeling threatened by the swarm of kobolds, Marissa foolishly tries to smite them again. Her base eminence score is now a –2, but her Charisma/Leadership bonus increases that to a 2. Melissa rolls an 18 and fails. The deity is getting a little tired of all Melissa’s attempts to call for special aid and bestows a deafness effect on her. Fortunately, her saving throw succeeds. Marissa’s base eminence score is now a –4, leaving her no chance to smite the kobolds again even if she was silly enough to try it again.
2 Somatic Concealment
Though spell casters can mumble verbal components and hide material components in their hands or robes, somatic components are harder to hide. The somatic component of any spell, magical or clerical, is apparent to any character watching the spell caster. Where spell casting is sometimes illegal, the ability to hide the necessary gestures becomes important. If movements can be concealed, a spell can be unleashed without calling attention to the caster.
A character using the somatic concealment proficiency must announce to the DM his intention to do so at the beginning of the round. Then, when the character casts his spell, the DM makes his roll in secret. A successful check indicates that anyone who could normally view the wizard doesn't recognize his gestures as magical in nature. A failed check means that all who can view the casting wizard see his movements for what they really are.
2 Soothsaying
This proficiency gives the character a limited ability to see into the future. When he acquires the proficiency, he must select a soothsaying technique. Possibilities include casting pebbles on the ground, snapping a branch and checking the splintered wood, studying the wrinkles on a subjects face, examining the entrails of an animal, or gazing at the stars. Once he selects a technique, he can't change it. To use this proficiency, he must employ his technique; for instance, if his technique involves gazing at the stars, he can't make a soothsaying attempt during the day.
If he can employ his technique, the character may pose a single yes-or-no question. The question must relate to an event occurring within the next 30 days. Among the acceptable questions: "Will we find treasure in the dragon's cave?", "Will our leader survive until the next full moon?", "Are these mushrooms safe to eat?".
The DM makes a proficiency check in secret. If the check fails, the character receives no information. If the check succeeds, the DM answers the question honestly; if the DM isn't sure of the correct answer, he may say that the outcome is uncertain. If the character asked a question that the DM wishes to remain unanswered - for instance, he may not want the character to know that the dragon's cave contains treasure, he may decline to give the character any information, even if the check succeeds. On a natural roll of 20, the DM gives the character an incorrect answer.
A character may use this proficiency once per week, regardless of whether the check succeeds or fails.
2 Sound Analysis
This proficiency allows a character to gauge the size of underground areas by generating noise and analyzing the echoes that return. Using this skill, he can calculate distances up to one mile, and determine sound direction.
To use sound analysis, the character must work in absolute silence. The sound created must have a sharp, staccato quality. A howl or wail is ineffective, but a clicking sound, or loud "hey" works well.
The PC must make a proficiency check. If the check is successful, he has correctly analyzed the size of the area in question to within plus or minus 25% of its height, width, and length. If the check fails, the echo has become garbled in its reverberations. No further attempts by the PC to analyze that area will succeed, though others with the proficiency may try.
A proficiency check of 5 or less means the character has learned not only the size of the analyzed area, but other details as well: the number of branching side passages, whether there is a straight or wandering corridor, and whether or not water exists.
The disadvantage of this ability is that, while it is useful for learning about a completely unknown area, it announces the characters to all creatures in hearing range. They will certainly be prepared, and may go looking for the intruders.
2 Sound Imitation
No description
2 Spacemanship
The character with this proficiency is familiar with spelljamming ships. He is qualified to work as a crewman, although he cannot actually navigate. Trained spacemen have general knowledge of all parts of their ship, can recognize the insignia of all ship's ranks, know basic information about air consumption, gravity plane orientation, and phlogiston safety, as well as being trained to perform common shipboard tasks. Crews of trained spacemen are necessary to manage any spelljamming ship.
2 Spell Recovery
When a person casts a spell on a plane where it won't work- like an illusion on Mechanus, for example — he loses the spell.  Wizards or priests with this proficiency can attempt to grab a hold of the useless, lost spell before it completely fades from their memory.  This works only when a spell becomes useless due to the magical conditions of a plane, layer, or realm.  Spells that fail simply because of other factors (like magic resistance or successful saving throws) cannot be recovered using this proficiency.  Obviously, once a body learns the dark of planar magic, this proficiency won't be as useful, 'cause the berk won't be casting useless spells in the first place.
2 Spell Sculpting
A wizard with this skill knows one spell so well the character can alter its statistics when casting it.
To use this skill, the wizard must prepare an item to help focus and reshape the spell’s magical energy. A focus item can be a small object such as a jewel, wand, or amulet. A focus item must be worth at least 500 gp per spell level.
When sculpting, the wizard must meet all the usual requirements to cast the spell; the wizard employs the focus item as an additional material component, which is normally not consumed. A successful skill roll allows the wizard to change the spell in a minor way, as listed below. If the roll fails, the spell is cast normally. If failure roll is a 20, the focus item is destroyed.
When a wizard successfully sculpts a spell, the character can choose one effect from the list below.
<ul>
<li>
Increase Damage: The spell can inflict an extra two dice of damage of the type normally rolled to determine the damage the spell inflicts. For example, Neja, a 20th level wizard, could sculpt a burning hands spell to inflict 3d3+20 points of damage. If Neja sculpted a fireball spell to increase damage, the spells would inflict 12d6 points of damage.
Spells that have individual damage dice, such as magic missile, are not increased individually. For example, Neja could cast a magic missile that inflicted a total of 7d4+7 points of damage. The additional damage could be added to a single missile or an additional die of damage could be added to two separate missiles.
Spells that do not use dice rolls to determine damage cannot be sculpted in this manner.
</li>
<li>
Extend Duration: The spell’s total duration is doubled. This applies only to the actual time a spell lasts but not to any special durations a spell may have.
For instance, invisibility would last a total of 48 hours or until the creature made an attack. Neja’s stoneskin would have a duration of 48 hours or until it had blocked 1d4+10 attacks (refer to the spell commentary for stoneskin). Spells with instantaneous durations cannot be sculpted in this manner.
</li>
<li>
Extend Range: The spell’s range is doubled. If the spell has a range of touch or 0, its range cannot be extended.
</li>
<li>
Shorten Casting Time: The spell’s casting time is cut in half, to a minimum of 1. If local conditions lengthen the spell’s casting time, apply the multiplier first, then cut the result in half.
</li>
</ul>
|* Wizard’s Level|Maximum Spell Level
|- 12–14|1st
|- 15–17|2nd
|- 18–20|3rd
|- 21–23|4th
|- 24–26|5th
|- 27–29|6th
|- 30+|7th
It is not possible to sculpt a spell more than once. It is possible, however, to employ a metamagic spell, such as extension or squaring the circle, to a spell that has been sculpted provided that the sculpting effect does not duplicate the metamagic spell effect. For example, a wizard cannot extend a spell’s duration and use an extension spell at the same time. A wizard could sculpt a spell to extend its range and use and extension spell to increase its duration.
The highest level spell a wizard can sculpt is limited by the character’s level, as shown to the right.
A wizard can learn to sculpt more than one spell but must pay the full cost for this skill for each spell. If the wizard improves the skill’s base score, the increase applies to all spells the wizard knows how to sculpt.
2 Spell Talisman
This skill allows a priest to cast one or more spells at the beginning of each day, making them available for instant use.
When a priest with this skill is finished praying for spells, the character can attempt to cast the spell and direct its magical energy into a special container or talisman. A talisman is a small object such as a jewel, crystal bead, or holy symbol blessed by the priest. A talisman must be worth at least 100 gp per spell level.
A successful skill roll is required to place a spell into a talisman. If the roll fails, the spell is wasted. The priest must have all necessary material components on hand and must meet all the usual requirements to cast a spell. If casting the spell has an effect on the priest, such as unnatural aging, the priest suffers the effect even if the spell was not placed in the talisman.
The total levels of spells a priest can have stored in talismans cannot exceed the priest’s level. The highest level spell a priest can place in a talisman depends on the priest’s level, as shown below:
|* Priest Level|Maximum Spell Level
|- 12–14|1st
|- 15–17|2nd
|- 18–20|3rd
|- 21–23|4th
|- 24–26|5th
|- 27–29|6th
|- 30+|7th
For example, Wulf, a 21st level priest, can have up to 21 levels of spells stored, but no stored spell can be higher than 4th level. Wulf might choose to store two spells of 4th level, two 3rd, and seven 1st level spells.
To release a spell from a talisman, the priest must be holding or carrying the item and have the opportunity to concentrate briefly and utter a few words. Though the initiative modifier for releasing the spell is +2, the release cannot be disrupted (though a gagged or silenced priest could not release the spell). Once the spell is released, it functions as if cast normally in all respects, destroying the talisman in the process.
A spell can be stored in a talisman for a maximum of 24 hours. If not used in the allotted time, or if separated from the priest for more than one hour, the talisman crumbles into dust and the spell is lost. No being other than the priest who stored the spell can release the stored energy.
A portion of the spell stored in a talisman lingers in the priest’s memory. If the priest memorizes spells again before the 24 hours have expired, the character cannot regain the spell stored in the talisman. The priest cannot transfer a spell from a talisman back into memory. If a talisman is destroyed, the spell is lost. A spell fades from the priest’s memory when it is released or lost.
Spells stored in talismans can be cast on worlds where the local magical factor would not allow the spell to be cast (see Chapter 2). A spell cannot be stored in talisman, however, unless the local conditions allow the spell to be cast. The initiative modifier for releasing a spell from a talisman is never affected by the local magical factor.
2 Spellcraft
Although this proficiency does not grant the character any spellcasting powers, it does give him familiarity with the different forms and rites of spellcasting. If he observes and overhears someone who is casting a spell, or if he examines the material components used, he can attempt to identify the spell being cast. A proficiency check must be rolled to make a correct identification. Wizard specialists gain a +3 bonus to the check when attempting to identify magic of their own school. Note that since the spellcaster must be observed until the very instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does not grant an advantage against combat spells. The proficiency is quite useful, however, for identifying spells that would otherwise have no visible effect.
Those talented in this proficiency also have a chance (equal to ½ of their normal proficiency check) of recognizing magical or magically endowed constructs for what they are.
2 Spelljamming
Characters with the spelljamming proficiency are experts at manipulating a spelljamming helm to maneuver a vessel. Any spell-caster can operate a helm, but this proficiency provides additional benifits.
* The character can boost the SR of his ship by 1 with a successful proficiency check. This boost lasts only one Spelljammer campaign turn.
* The character can boost the maneuverability of his ship with a proficiency check. This boost lasts only one turn. A character cannot boost both the speed and maneuverability of his ship at the same time.
* The character gains a -1 to his die rolls to determined which vessel gets initiative each turn.
In order to use these benifits, the character must be operating the ship's spelljamming helm. Bystanders cannot help, regardless of their proficiency.
2 Spelunking
A character with this proficiency has a thorough understanding of caves and underground passages, including their geology, formation, and hazards. The character generally knows what natural hazards are possible and what general equipment a spelunking party should outfit itself with. A successful proficiency check can reveal the following information:
* Determine, by studying cracks in the walls and pebbles on the floor, sniffing the air, etc., the likelihood of a cave-in, flash flood, or other natural hazard. This only works with respect to natural formations, and is negated if the natural formations have been shored up, bricked in, or otherwise tampered with.
* Estimate the time required to excavate a passage blocked with rubble.
* While exploring extensive underground caverns, a successful check reduces the chance of getting hopelessly lost when confronted by multiple unmarked passages, sinkholes, etc. to a maximum of 30%, assuming good lighting (see DMG Table 81-82).
2 Spirit Lore
(From Player's Option: Spells and Magic - Wis 2 Priest)
(From Complete Necromancers Handbook - Cha -4 Priest or Wizard)
A character with the spirit lore proficiency knows methods to contact spirits, deities, and extraplanar powers. He or she can more easily communicate with these beings, gaining a +5% chance of success (no ability check necessary) when attempting divinatory spells such as augury, contact other plane, commune, divination, speak with dead, summon spirits, and so on.
This ability may also be used to contact the dead without resorting to magic (handy for low-level characters and individuals who do not know magic, such as psionicists). Using pyromancy (divination by candles), tarot cards, and other mystical rites, the character can ask questions of these powers as if using a summon spirit or speak with dead spell (no body required, and there is no applicable time limit).
Before beginning the contact, the character must prepare for half an hour, making sure that the area has no spirits around to confuse readings. Contact with the dead is established if a successful check is made. A failed roll reveals nothing. If the roll is 10 more under the number needed, a specific spirit can be contacted. A roll of four or more above the needed number (or a 20) reveals incorrect information, perhaps from an evil spirit. Individuals with the psionic ability of spirit sense gain +2 to ability checks.
The summoner can ask questions of these spirits, but the spirits are not obliged to answer. If annoyed, the spirits can sever the link at will. The questioner can ask 1–3 questions, plus one for every slot above two spent on this proficiency. Contact may not be made more than once per day and is inadvisable more than once per week. The dead do not appreciate being disturbed and may take revenge. The DM can refer to the new 4th-level spell summon spirits for more details about interacting with the dead.
2 Spring*
The character can make astonishing jumps and leaps with blinding speed. At the cost of a half move or an attack, the character can spring into the air, attaining a height of five feet and landing up to two squares away in any direction. The character can flip and twist while airborne to achieve any facing when he lands. If the character has a 2-square running start, he can double his springing distance, landing up to four squares away and leaping 10 feet in the air, but the running start is a half-move action. For every additional slot spent on this skill, the character can add five feet and one square to the distance achieved.
For example, a character who as spent two slots on this skill could leap 10 feet into the air and land up to three squares away from a standing start. If the character's Dexterity/Balance roll fails, the character falls down in his landing square; he can get up during his next action phase, but can take no other actions until the following round. If the ability check succeeds, the character can finish the round normally after landing.
2 Steady Hand
Characters with this talent are excellent shots with bows or crossbows. They have an unusually good eye for distance, a knack for judging a tricky shot, and a smooth and easy aim and release. If the character takes a full round to aim his shot (i.e., voluntarily holds his action until last in the round) he suffers no penalty for a medium-range shot and only a –2 penalty for a long-range shot. If the character would normally receive multiple attacks with his weapon, he has to forfeit them in order to use this talent—he can make only one shot per round.
2 Stonemasonry
A stonemason is able to build structures from stone so that they last many years. He can do simple stone carvings, such as lettering, columns, and flourishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully fitted without mortar, or loosely fitted and chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemason equipped with his tools (hammers, chisels, wedges, block and tackle) can build a plain section of wall one foot thick, ten feet long, and five feet high in one day, provided the stone has already been cut. A stonemason can also supervise the work of unskilled laborers to quarry stone; one stonemason is needed for every five laborers. Dwarves are among the most accomplished stonemasons in the world; they receive a +2 bonus when using this skill.
2 Style Analysis
This specialized proficiency gives the character knowledge about (not skill in) armed and unarmed combat. After watching someone fight for at least one round, a character with this proficiency can make a Style Analysis check to learn some facts about his subject's fighting style.
If the character makes his check by the given amount, he learns the facts following that number.
<ol>
#0 The general style used (e.g., karate, kenjutsu, fencing, etc.).
#2 How good the practitioner is (e.g., a basic student, an expert, a grand master of the style, etc.).
#4 Which school of the style is being used (e.g., Odo family sumo wrestling).
#6 Superficial or transitory weaknesses that the practitioner is currently exhibiting (such as favoring an injured leg). The character with Style Analysis receives a +2 on all attack rolls when fighting the practitioner (unless the practitioner switches styles). The +2 wears off after one day.
#8 Who the practitioner's teacher probably was (e.g., Odo Kusuke).
#10 General weaknesses in the practitioner's learning (such as a tendency to favor left-side attacks over right-side ones). The character with Style Analysis receives a +2 on all attack rolls when fighting the practitioner. The +2 wears off after one year.
</ol>
Naturally, there are limits to what the character can learn even at the best levels of success. For example, he cannot learn the true identity of a teacher who is not commonly known, though he might be able to identify a style as being the same as another character's, thus inferring a common teacher.
2 Survival
This proficiency must be applied to a specific environment--i.e., a specific type of terrain and weather factors. Typical environments include arctic, woodland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. The character has basic survival knowledge for that terrain type. Additional proficiency slots can be used to add more types of terrain.
A character skilled in survival has a basic knowledge of the hazards he might face in that land. He understands the effects of the weather and knows the proper steps to lessen the risk of exposure. He knows the methods to locate or gather drinkable water. He knows how to find basic, not necessarily appetizing, food where none is apparent, thus staving off starvation. Furthermore, a character with survival skill can instruct and aid others in the same situation. When using the proficiency to find food or water, the character must roll a proficiency check. If the check is failed, no more attempts can be made that day.
The survival skill in no way releases the player characters from the hardships and horrors of being lost in the wilderness. At best it alleviates a small portion of the suffering. The food found is barely adequate, and water is discovered in minuscule amounts. It is still quite possible for a character with survival knowledge to die in  the wilderness. Indeed, the little knowledge the character has may lead to overconfidence and doom!
All rangers have basic survival skills in their primary terrain. Additional proficiency slots may be spent to add more terrain types. Thus, if a ranger spends slots to acquire this proficiency, he must choose a terrain type other than his primary terrain, giving him the survival proficiency in two types of terrain.
2 Survival, Hills & Mountains
No description
2 Survival, Planar
This proficiency encompasses a number of different proficiencies, one specific for each plane.  No character will ever learn them all, since they're just too many different enviroments for a body to fully understand them all.
A character with this proficiency knows the general characteristics of a particular plane.  Moreover, when on that plane, a character can determine whether something is safe or not.  This proficiency allows a character to check to see whether a plant's edible, the water's safe to drink, or if the gravity is going to change over the next ridge.  Only constant and established dangers can be avoided, for this proficiency has its basis in the study of established texts.  Something not even suggested in a book (because it is too new, too rare, or too remote) is impossible to detect.
Planar survival doesn't give a person unlimited knowledge about everything she comes across, however.  A plane is just too blasted big for a someone to know evrything about it, so the DM is free to throw plenty of surprises st a character with this skill.  Planar survival doesn't grant any knowledge about the denizens of a plane, only the enviroment.
This proficiency is a modified version of the "plane knowledge" proficiency (described in The Factol's Manifesto #2611), which is available to only members of the Fated.
2 Survival,Underground
Underground survival provides knowledge of the underground. It helps the character distinguish between edible and poisonous insects and to be able to determine the safety and stability of tunnels, cavern ceilings, and the like.
2 Swimming
A character with swimming proficiency knows how to swim and can move according to the rules given in the Swimming section (Chapter 14: Time and Movement). Those without this proficiency cannot swim. They can hold their breath and float, but they cannot move themselves about in the water.
2 Tactics
No description
2 Tactics of Magic
For many wizards, the principal use of their art is on the battlefield. Knowing which spell to employ at any given time and creating the greatest effect for one’s effort is a skill that can be learned with practice and experience. A wizard with the tactics of magic proficiency can attempt a proficiency check to gauge the range to a target, estimate how many enemies will be caught in a given area of effect, or determine whether or not he may be in danger of a rebounding lightning bolt or a fireball cast in too small a space.
In addition, a character with this skill may recall subtle effects or interactions that are not immediately apparent. For example, if the wizard is about to cast magic missile at an enemy wizard protected by a shield spell, the DM may allow the player a proficiency check to see if he suddenly recalls that the magic missile will fail—especially if the wizard also knows shield, but the player has just forgotten about the special effects of the spell. However, if there’s no way the character could know of a special immunity or property of a monster, spell, or magical item, this proficiency will not be of any help.
2 Tattooing
No description
2 Tea Ceremony
No description
2 Thaumaturgy
This is the art of the casting of magic, the study of the interaction of verbal, somatic, and material components in order to produce a desired effect. While all wizards have some degree of familiarity with this field of knowledge, a character who becomes proficient in thaumaturgy has spent time studying the forms and practices of magic. This depth of knowledge gives the wizard a +5% bonus on his learn spell rolls after a successful nonweapon proficiency check has been made.
2 Throwing
Characters with this proficiency add 10' to each range category of thrown weapons, and increases the damage or the attack roll by +1 each time they throw a weapon. The player can elect to improve either the damage or attack roll, but the choice must be announced before the attack is made.
For each character point spent on this proficiency (after its initial purchase) a character adds another 5' to thrown weapon ranges. For every 4 additional character points spent, another +1 on the damage or attack rolls is gained—this can be used as a +2 on one or the other, or split as a +1 to attack and +1 to damage.
2 Tightrope Walking
The character can attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams with greater than normal chances of success. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up or down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character can walk 60 feet. One proficiency check is made every 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indicating a fall. The check is made with a -10 penalty to the ability score if the surface is one inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 penalty if two inches to six inches wide, and unmodified if seven inches to 12 inches wide. Wider than one foot requires no check for proficient characters under normal circumstances. Every additional proficiency spent on tightrope walking reduces these penalties by 1. Use of a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.
The character can attempt to fight while on a tightrope, but he suffers a -5 penalty to his attack roll and must roll a successful proficiency check at the beginning of each round to avoid falling off. Since the character cannot maneuver, he gains no adjustments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he is struck while on the rope, he must roll an immediate proficiency check to retain his balance.
2 Time Sense
The character with this proficiency has an inner clock which allows him to keep track of the time without the aid of devices or astronomical sightings (the sun or stars). A successful check means that the character can estimate the time passed since the last verifiable time check within 3d10 minutes.
For every 24 hours that the character is without a verifiable source, this check must be made. Failure means that the character is off by 1-2 hours. The character knows something is wrong, but that's still his best guess. Subsequent checks are made using previous guesses as a base.
This ability can also be used to awaken at a certain time. An additional -1 modifier is applied when attempting this. Failure means oversleeping by one hour for every point by which the check is missed (up to four hours).
2 Toxicology
In the hands of the ninja, proficiency in Herbalism is bent toward knowledge of knockout drugs and poisons. A Toxicologist knows more about such drugs than an Herbalist with a similar Intelligence score (hence the lack of penalty), but will not know anything about other types of chemical compounds.
2 Tracking
|! Tracking Modifiers
|* Terrain|Modifier
|- Soft or muddy ground|+4
|- Thick brush, vines, or reeds|+3
|- Occasional signs of passage, dust|+2
|- Normal ground, wood floor|0
|- Rocky ground or shallow water|-10
|- Every two creatures in the group|+1
|- Every 12 hours since trail was made|-1
|- Every hour of rain, snow, or sleet|-5
|- Poor lighting (moon or starlight)|-6
|- Tracked party attempts to hide trail|-5
Characters with tracking proficiency are able to follow the trail of creatures and characters across most types of terrain. Characters who are not rangers roll a proficiency check with a -6 penalty to their ability scores; rangers have no penalty to their ability scores. In addition, other modifiers are also applied to the attempt, according to the table to the right.
The modifiers in the table above are cumulative--total the modifiers for all conditions that apply and combine that with the tracker's Wisdom score to get the modified chance to track.
For example, if Thule's Wisdom score is 16 and he is trying to track through mud (+4), at night (-6), during a sleet storm (-5), his chance to track is 9 (16+4-6-5). (Thule is a ranger so he does not suffer the -6 penalty for non-rangers tracking.)
For tracking to succeed, the creature tracked must leave some type of trail. Thus, it is virtually impossible to track flying or noncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow this in rare instances, but he should also assign substantial penalties to the attempt.
To track a creature, the character must first find the trail. Indoors, the tracker must have seen the creature in the last 30 minutes and must begin tracking from the place last seen. Outdoors, the tracker must either have seen the creature, have eyewitness reports of its recent movement ("Yup, we saw them orcs just high-tail it up that trail there not but yesterday."), or must have obvious evidence that the creature is in the area (such as a well-used game trail). If these conditions are met, a proficiency check is rolled. Success means a trail has been found. Failure means no trail has been found. Another attempt cannot be made until the above conditions are met again under different circumstances.
Once the trail is found, additional proficiency checks are rolled for the following situations:
* The chance to track decreases (terrain, rain, creatures leaving the group, darkness, etc.).
* A second track crosses the first.
* The party resumes tracking after a halt (to rest, eat, fight, etc.).
Once the tracker fails a proficiency check, another check can be rolled after spending at least one hour searching the area for new signs. If this check is failed, no further attempts can be made. If several trackers are following a trail, a +1 bonus is added to the ability score of the most adept tracker. Once he loses the trail, it is lost to all.
If the modifiers lower the chance to track below 0 (for example, the modifiers are -11 and the character's Wisdom is 10), the trail is totally lost to that character and further tracking is impossible (even if the chance later improves). Other characters may be able to continue tracking, but that character cannot.
A tracking character can also attempt to identify the type of creatures being followed and the approximate number by rolling a proficiency check. All the normal tracking modifiers apply. One identifying check can be rolled each time a check is rolled to follow the trail. A successful check identifies the creatures (provided the character has some knowledge of that type of creature) and gives a rough estimate of their numbers. Just how accurate this estimate is depends on the DM.
|! Movement While Tracking
|* Chance to Track|Movement Rate
|- 1-6|¼ normal
|- 7-14|¼ normal
|- 14 or greater|3/4 normal
When following a trail, the character (and those with him) must slow down, the speed depending on the character's modified chance to track as found from the table to the right.
In the earlier example, Thule has a modified tracking chance of 9, so he moves at ½ his normal movement rate.
Most rangers will have this proficiency in outdoor land terrain without spending any slots. Generally, success chances in urban, man-made, or aquatic terrains are halved, unless a specific kit description says otherwise. Some kits give tracking in alternative terrains instead of the usual outdoor land environment.
2 Trail Marking
By notching trees, scattering pebbles, piling stones, and clipping weeds, the character can mark a trail through any wilderness area. Providing he moves at 2/3 his normal movement rate, he can mark a continuous trail as long as he likes; however, the longer the trail, the less likely he'll be able to follow it back.
A successful proficiency check enables a backtracking character to follow his own trail for a distance equal to his level in miles. If he fails a check, he loses the trail. For instance, assume a 3rd level character marked a 12-mile trail. His first successful proficiency check enables him to follow this trail back three miles. A second successful proficiency check means he can follow the trail another three miles. The third check fails, and he loses the trail; he's only been able to follow his trail for a total of six miles.
The tracking proficiency isn't necessary to use the trail marking proficiency. However, when a ranger loses his own marked trail, he may still attempt to follow it using his tracking proficiency. Any other characters with the tracking proficiency may also attempt to follow a ranger's marked trail, using the rules applicable to the tracking proficiency.
A marked trail lasts unless it is obscured by precipitation, a forest fire, or the passage of time (an undisturbed trail marked in a forest should last for weeks, while an arctic trail may last less than a day during periods of heavy precipitation; the DM decides). A ranger or other character with the tracking proficiency may still attempt to follow an obscured trail using the tracking rules.
2 Trail Signs
A character with this proficiency can read symbolic messages indicated by an arrangement of stones or other physical objects. The character must designate the method of leaving messages preferred by his family, tribe, or culture. Typical methods include piling rocks, stacking branches, or building snow sculptures. When the character encounters such a message, he understands the meaning if he makes a successful proficiency check. ("A dragon dwells in these woods." "Eat the green berries for restored health.") The message is meaningless to characters without the trail signs proficiency. A character with the trail signs proficiency who uses methods other than the one encountered can try to read it at half the normal chance for success. This proficiency can also be used to identify the cultural group or tribe that has left a specific trail sign.
2 Trailing
Trailing resembles tracking, except tracking is associated chiefly with the wilderness, and trailing typically is used in major urban centers (i.e., cities and large towns). It is the talent of tailing someone—of keeping a certain distance or even catching up to them, though they may be attempting to blend into a crowd, or at least get lost in the confusion of a street full of people.
A proficiency check is first made to see if the thief is able to trail without being noticed. If the person followed has the alertness proficiency, then the thief suffers a -5 penalty.
If the thief is noticed, the person being followed may attempt to evade. To keep from losing the trail, the thief must make another proficiency check. A modifier from  -3 to +3 (varying from first time in a foreign city to the thief's home neighborhood) may be used, if the DM so chooses, to reflect how well the thief knows the area. Warn the player beforehand if you will apply modifiers (though you needn't tell exactly what they are).
The DM should feel free to use situational modifiers on these rolls. For example, if a street is relatively clear, the thief should get -1 or -2 on an attempt to follow unnoticed, but +1 or +2 if he has been seen and is chasing after his subject. The opposite numbers could be used for exceptionally crowded situations, or at night.
For any Trailing proficiency roll, a -3 penalty applies if the person followed has the Trailing proficiency as well (and, presumably, knows better how to foil the tricks of his own trade).
2 Trance
No description
2 Trouble Sense
Sometimes known as a danger sense, this talent gives the character a chance to detect otherwise undetectable threats by instinct. The character's trouble sense comes into play when the character is threatened by a danger he hasn't noticed yet.
The DM should make trouble sense checks in secret. If the character succeeds, he is only surprised on a roll of 1 by a sneak attack and treats any rear attacks as flank attacks instead. The DM can modify the proficiency check if the character is taking extra precautions or if the attacker would be particularly hard to notice before striking.
2 Tumbling
The character is practiced in all manner of acrobatics--dives, rolls, somersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling can only be performed while burdened with light encumbrance or less. Aside from entertaining, the character with tumbling proficiency can improve his Armor Class by 4 against attacks directed solely at him in any round of combat, provided he has the initiative and foregoes all attacks that round. When in unarmed combat he can improve his attack roll by 2.
On a successful proficiency check, he suffers only one-half the normal damage from falls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of 10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights result in normal damage.
2 Undead Knowledge
No description
2 Undead Lore
A priest with this proficiency is trained in the identification, powers, and vulnerabilities of common undead monsters. With a proficiency check, the character can recall specific tactics or weaknesses of a monster; for example, if confronted by a vampire, he may recall that a mirror, garlic, or holy symbol strongly presented can drive the monster away for a short time. How the character uses this information is up to the player.
2 Underclass
This proficiency imparts an understanding of the way the underclass—the combination of poorer classes and criminal elements—works in a society. The character with this proficiency can roll an Underclass check to learn things about the underworld of any community he visits. The DM should assign time and check penalties based on cultural differences and the sensitivity of the information the character seeks. Attempting to buy an illegal weapon would take about an hour and result in a check penalty of 0 or –1. Looking for the secret hideout of the local master of crime might take weeks and would impose a penalty of –8 or worse.
2 Vehicle Handling
No description
2 Venom Handling
With this proficiency, a character learns how to safely use both magical and mundane poisons. There is no danger of such a character accidentally stabbing someone with a poisoned weapon. Also, the character can identify a poison and a possible antidote by visual inspection of the venom or its symptoms in a victim (with an ability check). In addition, a character can identify naturally occurring animals, plants, or monsters that are poisonous (with an ability check). Any roll which fails by 4 or more results in a misidentification of both the poison and its antidote.
At the DM's discretion, characters with also the animal handling, herbalism, and brewing nonweapon proficiencies may be able to manufacture some of the more deadly poisons listed on page 73 of the DMG. The cost and time required for such an activity should be adjudicated by the DM, but providing all of the components are personally harvested by the character, it should take no less than 1–6 days to make one dose of poison. Magical poisons cannot be manufactured using this ability.
2 Ventriloquism
|* Intelligence|Modifier
|- less than 3|+6
|- 3-5|+4
|- 6-8|+2
|- 9-14|0
|- 15-16|-1
|- 17-18|-2
|- 19+|-4
The character has learned the secrets of "throwing his voice." Although not actually making sound come from somewhere else (like the spell), the character can deceive others into believing this to be so. When using ventriloquism, the supposed source of the sound must be relatively close to the character. The nature of the speaking object and the intelligence of those watching can modify the character's chance of success. If the character makes an obviously inanimate object talk (a book, mug, etc.), a -5 penalty is applied to his ability score. If a believable source (a PC or NPC) is made to appear to speak, a +2 bonus is added to his ability score. The observer's intelligence modifies this as follows:
A successful proficiency check means the character has successfully deceived his audience. One check must be made for every sentence or response. The character is limited to sounds he could normally make (thus, the roar of a lion is somewhat beyond him).
Since ventriloquism relies on deception, people's knowledge of speech, and assumptions about what should and shouldn't talk, it is effective only on intelligent creatures. Thus, it has no effect on animals and the like. Furthermore, the audience must be watching the character since part of the deception is visual ("Hey, his lips don't move!"). Using ventriloquism to get someone to look behind him does not work, since the voice is not actually behind him (this requires the ventriloquism spell). All but those with the gullibility of children realize what is truly happening. They may be amused--or they may not be.
2 Veterinary Healing
The character can attempt to heal all types of normal animals, following the same procedures described in the description of the healing proficiency (returns 1-3 hit points if done within one round of wounding, once per creature per day; continued care can restore 1 hit point per day during non-strenuous traveling for up to 6 creatures; gives a +2 to save vs. poison if treated for 5 rounds within a round after poisoning; diagnose disease, magical origins identified, natural diseases take mildest form and shortest duration). Supernatural creatures (such as skeletons or ghouls) or creatures from another plane (such as aerial servants or xorn) cannot be treated with this proficiency.
This proficiency is not cumulative with the healing proficiency--the first used will take precedence. The veterinary proficiency can be used on humans, demihumans, and humanoids at half the normal chance for success.
2 Voice Mimicry
Voice mimicry is the art of convincingly imitating the voices of other people. It is a very demanding skill, needing intense training of and practice with the vocal cords. For this reason it requires two nonweapon proficiency slots.
A character with voice mimicry is able to imitate any accent he has heard. Success is automatic unless people who themselves speak in that accent are his listeners; in such a case, a proficiency roll is required (with a +2 modifier).
More difficult is the imitation of a specific person's voice. To do this, the thief must, of course, be familiar with the voice. A proficiency check is needed to determine if the imitation is detected; modifiers depend on how well the listeners know the voice that is being mimicked. Success is of course certain if the listener is a stranger, someone who has never heard the original voice. To fool an acquaintance, there is no modifier; while fooling a friend of the subject is at  -2, a close friend -5, and someone extremely close (e.g., parent or spouse—someone who has had close contact with the person for years) is at -7.
This ability is often used in conjunction with the disguise proficiency. Which proficiency must be checked first depends on whether the character is seen or heard. If the disguise first is successful, there is a +5 modifier to the voice mimicry—the listeners have already accepted the appearance, so they are less likely to doubt the voice. If the disguise fails, it doesn't matter how good the voice imitation is. If the voice is successfully mimicked first, it gives a +1 modifier to the disguise check.
2 Water Find
Even the most barren desert yields water to those who know how to find it. Small animals burrow in the ground and store water there; some rare plants store water in cistern roots beneath the soil; seemingly lifeless trees sometimes have moist heartwood. The find water proficiency can only be used once per day and takes an hour to perform. During this time the character can only move half as far as normal. A successful check indicates he has found sufficient water to sustain himself for one day. It does not mean that he has found enough water to rehydrate, but he will not further dehydrate that day. The character can only find enough water for himself-if he shares his find with others, none of them gains any benefit.
2 Water Walking
This proficiency allows the character to correctly use mizugumo, the special pontoons that ninja use to walk across still water surfaces. The ninja must make a proficiency check each round. An unsuccessful check means the ninja falls into the water with a big splash.
2 Weapon Improvisation
With this proficiency, the character can improvise a weapon from natural materials. He must search the area for 1d6 rounds, then make a proficiency check. If the check fails, he finds nothing useful; he may try again in a different area. If the check succeeds, he finds an object that can be wielded as a club, such as a branch, a bone, or an icicle. The improvised weapon inflicts 1d6+ 1 damage to man-sized and smaller creatures, or 1d3+ 1 to larger opponents. On a natural roll of 1 or 2, the object has jagged projections or is sufficiently heavy to cause additional damage: man-sized and smaller creatures suffer 1d6+ 3 damage, larger opponents suffer 1d3+ 3 damage. On a natural roll of 20, the improvised weapons shatters or splinters on its first use, causing no damage; its useless thereafter.
The DM may veto the use of this proficiency in inappropriate environments, such as a barren plain or a snow-filled valley. Likewise, he may impose penalties or bonuses to the check in areas where improvised weapons are exceptionally difficult or easy to find. For example, a hill covered with stones might merit a + 1 bonus; an empty plain might merit a -2 penalty; a marketplace might warrant a + 2: and a sandy desert might annul the proficiency altogether.
A barbarian receives a +2 bonus when searching for an improvised weapon in his homeland terrain.

This highly specialized proficiency enables a character to perform the difficult and highly exacting work involved in making metal weapons, particularly those with blades. The character blends some of the skill of the blacksmith with an ability to create blades of strength and sharpness. A fully equipped smithy is necessary to use this proficiency.
The time and cost to make various types of weapons are listed on the table below.
A dwarf weaponsmith is not only more skilled than a human one (Intelligence -1, instead of -3), but capable of producing weapons at a faster rate. The costs remain the same.

|- c2 * Seasoning the wood takes 1 year.
This proficiency allows the making simple weapons out of natural materials. This skill is most often found in those from a primitive, tribal, or savage background.
The crude weapons are limited to natural materials: stone, wood, bone, sinew, reed, and the like. Crude weapons take a certain amount of time to make. The DM may add additional primitive weapons to the basic list.
The chance for success is based on the character's Wisdom, with a -3 penalty. Any warrior or a character with the hunting proficiency has a +3 bonus. The fashioner must be proficient in the use of the weapon.
If successful, the weapon can be used normally. If failed, the weapon is so badly flawed as to be useless. On a roll of 20, the weapon seems sound, but will break upon first use. On a roll of 1, the weapon has no chance of breaking except against a harder material.
Optional: Crude weapons check for breaking upon inflicting damage; roll 1d6. Bone weapons break on a roll of 1 or 2, stone weapons break on a roll of 1.
Barbarians: A barbarian may only fashion weapons commonly used in his homeland.
2 Weather Sense
This proficiency enables the character to make intelligent guesses about upcoming weather conditions. A successful proficiency check means the character has correctly guessed the general weather conditions in the next six hours. A failed check means the character read the signs wrong and forecast the weather incorrectly. The DM should roll the check secretly. A proficiency check can be made once every six hours. However, for every six hours of observation, the character gains a +1 bonus to his ability score (as he watches the weather change, the character gets a better sense of what is coming). This modifier is cumulative, although sleep or other activity that occupies the attention of the character for a long period negates any accumulated bonus.
Sometimes impending weather conditions are so obvious that no proficiency check is required. It is difficult not to notice the tornado funnel tearing across the plain or the mass of dark clouds on the horizon obviously headed the character's way. In these cases, the player should be able to deduce what is about to happen to his character anyway.
2 Weaving
A character with weaving proficiency is able to create garments, tapestries, and draperies from wool or cotton. The character requires a spinning apparatus and a loom. A weaver can create two square yards of material per day.
2 Whistling/Humming
Almost anyone can whistle or hum. Those who take this proficiency are exceptional whistlers and hummers. They can produce tunes as captivating as most songs. A person with this proficiency is a true master whistler and hummer.
It is so easy to learn a new tune to whistle or hum that characters with this proficiency can learn numerous tunes. In fact, if a proficiency check is made, a whistler or hummer knows any particular tune in question. In addition, a character with both this proficiency and the animal lore proficiency can mimic any bird call he has heard.
However, most adventurers do not take whistling just for the entertainment value. Instead, they are looking for its uses in communication. This communication is possible only among those who know this proficiency. If both characters succeed with their proficiency checks, a single concept can be communicated. Some examples are "Go around to the side door," "I hear them coming," "Slowly reach out now, the guard doesn't see you."
2 Wild Fighting
Characters with this proficiency employ an extremely unorthodox and unpredictable fighting style. Wild fighting is ferocious and deadly, without any grace or discipline. It is also extremely tiring, as part of its nature is that it focuses every bit of energy a character has into the attack.
The benefits are in the number of attacks the character gets and in the amount of damage attacks inflict. A wild-fighting character gets one more attack per round than normally entitled to. All damage rolls for attacks that hit receive a +3 bonus.
However, when wild fighting, a character's attack rolls also are reduced by 3. Also the attacker's armor class is penalized by 3, making it easier to hit him.
To use wild fighting, a character must make a successful proficiency check at the start of combat. A failure means that the character receives only the penalties of the proficiency and none of the benefits.
Wild fighting can only be used twice per day, as it is extremely tiring. After a battle ends, the wild fighter must rest for one hour before he can again call on the proficiency. Resting means doing nothing but resting or engaging in light travel (riding a slow-moving horse, etc,). If the character must walk, he cannot use the proficiency until four hours have passed. Without this rest, a tired character suffers a -3 penalty to all proficiency checks, a -5 to armor class, a -5 to THAC0, and a -3 from damage rolls. These penalties are in effect until the full resting period has elapsed.
2 Winemaking
This proficiency allows characters to create wine from the fermented juice of grapes or other plants and fruits well enough to make a living at it. The character will always succeed to some extent; proficiency checks are only required when attempting to prepare a truly magnificent wine as a special gift or for a special celebration.
2 Zero-gravity Combat
A character with zero-gravity combat proficiency is skilled at fighting in the absense of gravity. The character suffers a +3 penalty on initiative rolls and a -1 penalty on all attack rolls (as compared to a +6 initiative penalty and a -2 attack roll penalty for characters without this proficiency.)
Furthermore, the character retains the ability to use special combat abilities, such as martial arts, while drifting in space.
Finally the character car roughly steer his course in space by throwing objects away from him and by shifting toward large objects. He cannot control his speed, however, and can only slightly affect his course.

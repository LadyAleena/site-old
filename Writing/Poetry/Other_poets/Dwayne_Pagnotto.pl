2 Lightning Caress
stanza Rain, i'm choked in it, soaked in it|I wanna play in it, pray in it|Just spend all day in it.
I can't get enough of this fabulous stuff.
stanza As we ran from shelter to shelter|One day after school|During a thunderstorm...i felt her.
We danced around naked under the cover of trees
As refreshing drops fell from the leaves.
stanza Goosepimpled flesh|We were now getting cold.
stanza We made love in the grass|Now feeling bold.
stanza Then as the rain stopped falling|I kissed her all the way home.
That day we made a rainbow of our own.

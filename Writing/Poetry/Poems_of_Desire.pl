__DATA__
2 To all the men I have loved before
stanza I know that we have had fun|Fun with our bodies|Fun with our senses
stanza I know that at one time I gave|Gave you my body|Gave into the fun
stanza I know that I said I love you|You had my body|You had my soul
stanza I know that I left you all alone|All alone without my body|All alone without my soul
stanza I know that you left me alone|Alone without your touch|Alone without your love
stanza I am with someone else now|He fills my senses with passion|He fills my heart with love|He fills my body and my soul
I won't leave him nor he me.
2 Secret Love
stanza My heart is misplaced|My mind acknowledges
>6 my pain.
stanza My body felt his touch|My soul went up
>6 in flames.
stanza I see his face constantly|I hear his voice inside
>6 my head.
stanza I feel his hands on me|I must know why I
>6 feel dread.
stanza Heart broken I stand.|Soul pierced I fall
>6 broken.

>6 spoken.

2 Illicit Love
stanza I desire your touch on my skin|I want to feel you inside of me again.|I long for your caresses on my flesh|I need you to love me again.
stanza I miss your arms around me still|I cry not, with only strength of will.|My heart grows colder with time.|My love for you I must kill.
stanza I crossed that line not knowing.|I hide it within me not showing|I love you against the rules we set|Yet I found it inside of me growing.
stanza Once I almost said those words.|Once I was tempted with the absurd.|I know you will never be mine.|I am entangled in love's cords.
stanza I let my heart freedom to roam|And now it won't come back home.|I regret only one thing in this affair.|That I can't have you for my own.

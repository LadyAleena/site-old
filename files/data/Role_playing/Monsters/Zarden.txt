Zarden are a crossbreed between lizardmen and humans. Their appearance varies on how close to either parent species the zarden is.
A zarden will fight with whatever is at hand. A zarden has more focus than lizardmen, and they do not eat their adversaries (unless they are very close to being a lizardman).
Zarden identify with a tribe, however they live cities among humans. There are very few who have been allowed to live with a lizardman tribe.

As Zarden are a crossbreed species, some of them are more human or lizardman.

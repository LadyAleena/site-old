__DATA__
The timeline covers everything from A<Official Timeline of Xanth|href="http://www.hipiers.com/timeline.html">, which goes through ^Swell Foop^ that takes place in Xanthian year ^1101^. The A<pdf|href="http://www.hipiers.com/Timeline.pdf"> goes through ^Pet Peeve^ that takes place in Xanthian year ^1105^. I<A Spell for Chameleon>, the first novel in the series, took place in Xanthian year ^1042^. It is now Xanthian year ^1117^.
After I<A Spell for Chameleon>, ^1042^, many events happen almost every year. From ^Isle of View^, ^1089^, onward; the novels happen every year thereafter. The only exception is ^Ghost Writer in the Sky^, the last novel, which takes place two years after ^Isis Orb^.
This list is separated by Kings and Waves, invasions or colonizations of humans from Mundania.
SMALL<I am currently cleaning this up, my apologies for the mess at the moment.>
2 Xanth connected to Mundania
Around the year 9000 BFW, Demons ^Gaia^ and ^Earth^ made a bet on the pronunciation of the place known as Mundania or Moondania. Both thought they won, and a landbound connection was made between it and Xanth. The matter was finally decided in ^1107^.
2 The arrival of X(A/N)th
Around the year 4000 BFW, before first wave, the Demon X(A/N)th is banished to realm of Xanth by other senior demons. The date is could be off by about ten thousand years as an accurate timeline is not possible. X(A/N)th's presence caused magic to slowly infuse the realm due to minor leakage from his essence.
2 Before the First Wave
In year 2200 BFW, a colony of humans arrive from Mundania. The colony grows for a while until Magicians and Sorceresses start manifesting. One of the early Sorceresses is the ^Sea Hag^ Peril, mostly unknown to others because of her frequent change of bodies. Many uncounted waves happen between this year and 2100 BFW.
Around year 2100 BFW, Xanth is cut off from Mundania, becoming a true island.
In year 1900 BFW, the human colony has failed by crossbreeding itself to extinction. The humans become assorted magic species through the crossbreeding or were changed by magic. Harpies, merfolk, nagas, sphinxes, ogres, goblins, elves, fauns, nymphs, fairies, various Winged Monsters, and other crossbreeds and variants are suspected to have derived from this. Most species tend to be close-mouthed about it, evidently preferring not to admit the debasement of their lineage by human stock. Thus this colony is unknown to history, except by the mute evidence of the surviving species. 
In year 1000 BFW, the isthmus is restored and limited contact with Mundania is resumed. The last survivors of the human colony form the Interface to allow limited contact with Mundania, but it is imperfect. The city of Hinge is deserted.
Around year 800 BFW, the centaur species begins.

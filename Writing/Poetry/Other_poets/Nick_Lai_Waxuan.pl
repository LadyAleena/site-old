stanza Crystal clear and deep wide eyes|So beautiful that it made the fey cry|Gentle hands smooth and fair|Constantly adjusts and smoothes her hair.
stanza Coyness exudes an air of innocence|In a garden of peach blossom fragrance|She walks by them, and the branches shiver|The falling petals, a sight that made her quiver
stanza Guided by inspiration, a dance improvised|Took my breath away, no mortal words can devise|I sketch her portrait, on the other side|Unknown to her, I sketch a work of pride
stanza Such beauty that my words cannot describe|I sketch her beauty, and wish for her to be my bride

stanza Soft blankets pulled overhead|As two figured lay together on bed|Quivering lips locked in passion|One's deep lust makes a confession.
stanza Two bodies joined as one|In a dance that is exciting and fun|The heat of the moment is overwhelmingly good|After this bout they are still in the mood.
stanza The scent of love is in the air|The skin of the maiden beautiful and fair|Her hair long and soft, silky and smooth|The alluring swing each time she moves.
stanza This consumation of love both hold dear|As long as they are together, there is nothing to fear.

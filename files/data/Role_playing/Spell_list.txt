Advanced Illusion|Illusion/Phantasm|5|60 yds + 10 yds/level|1 rd/level|One 40-ft cube + one 10-ft cube/level|V, S, M|1 rd|Special|This spell is essentially a spectral forces spell that operates through a program (similar to a programmed illusion spell) determined by the caster. It is thus unnecessary for the wizard to concentrate on the spell for longer than the round of casting it, as the program has then started and will continue without supervision. The illusion has visual, audio, olfactory, and thermal components. If any viewer actively attempts to disbelieve the spell, he gains a saving throw vs. spell. If any viewer successfully disbelieves and communicates this fact to other viewers, each such viewer gains a saving throw vs. spell with a +4 bonus./The material components are a bit of fleece and several grains of sand.
Cloudkill|Evocation|5|10 yds|1 rd/level|40×20×20 ft cloud|V, S|5|None|This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4+1 Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4+1 to 5+1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poison with -4 penalties or be slain, and creatures with up to 6 Hit Dice (inclusive) to roll unmodified saving throws vs. poison or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect./The cloudkill moves away from the spellcaster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast under water.
Color|Alteration|1|Touch|Permanent|8 square yrds|V, S, M|Special|None|The spell allows a wizard to effect a permanent color change in cloth, leather, or similar substance. The speed at which the change takes place is variable. With a gesture, the caster can instantaneously make an entire piece change to a single hue. If several colors are desired the caster must trace with his fingers the areas he intends to color and picture the desired hue for the area outlined; the color changes accordingly. Any color or shade  can be created, including metallic tints, though the latter cannot actually consist of precious metals. Any color changes must be done with two hours, the spell's maximum casting time. The effect is permanent until dispelled.
Color Spray|Alteration|1|0|Instantaneous|5×20×20 ft wedge|V, S, M|1|Special|Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from his hand. From one to six creatures (1d6) within the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard. All creatures above the level of the spellcaster and all those of 6th level or 6 Hit Dice or more are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. Blind or unseeing creatures are not affected by the spell./Creatures not allowed or failing saving throws, and whose Hit Dice or levels are less than or equal to the spellcaster's level, are struck unconscious for 2d4 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 1 or 2 greater than the wizard's level are blinded for 1d4 rounds; those with Hit Dice or levels 3 or more greater than that of the spellcaster are stunned (reeling and unable to think or act coherently) for one round./The material components of this spell are a pinch each of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue.
Cone of Cold|Evocation|5|0|Instantaneous|Special|V, S, M|5|½|When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of extreme cold, originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a cone 5 feet long and 1 foot in diameter per level of the caster. It drains heat and causes 1d4+1 points of damage per level of experience of the wizard. For example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold 10 feet in diameter and 50 feet long, causing 10d4+10 points of damage./Its material component is a crystal or glass cone of very small size.
Continual Light|(Alteration) <i>Reversible</i>|2|60 yds|Permanent|60-ft radius|V, S|2|Special|This spell is similar to a light spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. When cast at a creature, the target gets a saving throw vs. spell; success indicates that the spell affects the space about 1 foot behind the creature instead. Note that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs, reducing its attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed./A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both./This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials can last hundreds or even thousands of years.
Death Fog|Alteration, Evocation|6|30 yds|1d4 rds + 1/level|Two 10-ft cubes/level|V, S, M|6|None|
Detect Illusion|Divination, Mentalism|1|Touch|3 rds + 2 rds/level|10 ft×10 ft/level path|V, S, M|1|None|By means of this spell the wizard is able to see an illusion and know it for exactly that.  Other can be enabled to see illusions as unreal if the caster touched the creatures with both hands while the creature looks at the illusion./The material component is a piece of yellow-tinted crystal, glass, or mica.
Detect Invisibility|Divination|2|0|5 rds/level|10 yds/level|V, S, M|2|None|When the wizard casts a detect invisibility spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addition, it enables the wizard to detect hidden or concealed creatures (for example, thieves in shadows, halflings in underbrush, and so on). It does not reveal the method of concealment or invisibility, except in the case of astral travelers (where the silver cord can be seen). It does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Detection is a path 10 ft. wide along the wizard's line of sight to the range limit./The material components of this spell are a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver.
Disintegrate|Alteration|6|5 yds/level|Instantaneous|1 creature or 10×10×10 ft cube|V, S, M|6|Neg|This spell causes matter to vanish. It affects even matter (or energy) of a magical nature, such as Bigby's forceful hand, but not a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic shell. Disintegration is instantaneous, and its effects are permanent. Any single creature can be affected, even undead. Nonliving matter, up to a 10-footÃ—10-footÃ—10-foot cube, can be obliterated by the spell. The spell creates a thin, green ray that causes physical material touched to glow and vanish, leaving traces of fine dust. Creatures that successfully save vs. spell have avoided the ray (material items have resisted the magic) and are not affected. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected./The material components are a lodestone and a pinch of dust.
Dispel Illusion|Abjuration|4|10 yds/level|Instantaneous|1 illusion or phantasm|V, S|4|Special|Wielding this spell, an illusionist or wu jen can instantly dispel any illusion or phantasm cast by a wizard of another school. However, against a spell of mixed schools, their own schools, and nonwizard illusions, this spell acts as a dispel magic spell (11 or higher on a 1d20 to dispel, Â±1 per level difference). At the DM's option, this spell may affect items that create illusion and phantasmal effects as well.
Dispel Magic|Abjuration|3|120 yds|Instantaneous|30-ft cube|V, S|3|None|
Domination|Enchantment/Charm|5|10 yds/level|Special|1 person|V, S|5|Neg|The domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any person until the spell is ended by the subject's Intelligence (see the charm person spell). Elves and half-elves resist this enchantment as they do all charm-type spells. When the spell is cast, the subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell at a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjustments apply. Failure means the wizard has established a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common language is shared, the wizard can generally force the subject to perform as the wizard desires, within the limits of the subject's body structure and Strength. Note that the caster does not receive direct sensory input from the subject./Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, there is no limit to the range at which it can be exercised, as long as the caster and subject are on the same plane./A protection from evil spell can prevent the caster from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it cannot prevent the establishment of domination.
Enchant an Item|Enchantment, Invocation|6|Touch|Special|1 item|V, S, M|Special|Neg|This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted./The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process./The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)/At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again./Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the prior spell failed./No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose./The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play.
Fear|Illusion/Phantasm|4|0|Special|0-ft cone, 30-ft diameter at end, 5-ft at base|V, S, M|4|Neg|When a fear spell is cast, the wizard sends forth an invisible cone of terror that causes creatures within its area of effect to turn away from the caster and flee in panic. Affected creatures are likely to drop whatever they are holding when struck by the spell; the base chance of this is 60% at 1st level (or at 1 Hit Die), and each level (or Hit Die) above this reduces the probability by 5%. Thus, at 10th level there is only a 15% chance, and at 13th level no chance, of dropping items. Creatures affected by fear flee at their fastest rate for a number of melee rounds equal to the level of experience of the spellcaster. Undead and creatures that successfully roll their saving throws vs. spell are not affected./The material component of this spell is either the heart of a hen or a white feather.
Find Beacon|Divination|4|Special|1d4 hours/level|One Beacon|V, M|2|None|By means of the spell, the caster can find a single Teleport Beacon and know the surroundings of that Beacon./The material component is this spell is an enchanted crystal sphere which is not destroyed in the casting./This spell is known only to the Society of Divided Light.
Fog Cloud|Alteration|2|10 yds|4 rds + 1 rd/level|Special|V, S|2|None|<p>The fog cloud spell can be cast in one of two ways, at the caster's option: as a large, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a harmless fog that resembles the 5th-level wizard spell cloudkill./As a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of any size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot cube per caster level. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond 2 feet./As a cloudkill-like fog, this is a billowing mass of ghastly, yellowish-green vapors, measuring 40 feetÃ—20 feetÃ—20 feet. This moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round. The vapors are heavier than air and sink to the lowest level, even pouring down sinkholes and den openings. Very thick vegetation breaks up the fog after it has moved 20 feet into the vegetation./The only effect of either version is to obscure vision. A strong breeze will disperse either effect in one round, while a moderate breeze will reduce the spell duration by 50%. The spell cannot be cast under water.
Gust of Wind|Alteration|5|0|1 rd|10 ft×10 yds/level|V, S, M|3|None|When this spell is cast, a strong puff of air originates from the wizard and moves in the direction he is facing. The force of this gust of wind (about 30 m.p.h.) is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames--such as those of lanterns--to dance wildly and has a 5% chance per level of experience of the spellcaster to extinguish even such lights. It also fans large fires outward 1d6 feet in the direction of the wind's movement. It forces back small flying creatures 1d6Ã—10 yards and causes man-sized beings to be held motionless if attempting to move against its force. It slows larger-than-man-sized flying creatures by 50% for one round. It blows over light objects, disperses most vapors, and forces away gaseous or unsecured levitating creatures. Its path is a constant 10 feet wide, by 10 yards long per level of experience of the caster (for example, an 8th-level wizard causes a gust of wind that travels 80 yards)./The material component of the spell is a legume seed.
Hold Vapor|Abjuration|3|10 yds/level|3|20 ft + 10 ft level radius|V, S, M|Special (maximum 1 hr)|Special|This spell allows a wizard to halt and prevent the further movement of any visible cloud or vapor within the spell's range and area of effect.  Such clouds include gaseous breath weapons,  fog cloud, cloudkill, and incendiary cloud as well as the smokey effects of pyrotechnics.  Other objects and creatures can pass freely through this barrier, moving into and out of the gas-filled area.  A volatile gas could be contained by the spell and safely incinerated by tossing a torch through the barrier./The hold vapor spell will restrain gas clouds even against magical and natural winds.  A creature in gaseous form or airlike form (air elemental djinns, and vampires, for example) can be contained by this spell.  In these cases, the creature being contained is permitted a saving throw vs. spell each round to break through the barrier.  Gaseous creatures cannot transform from their gaseous state when being contained./The spell lasts for as long as the wizard continues chanting, to a maximum of one hour, at which time the spell fades and the cloud (if it is still there) settles or drifts naturally.  The wizard can move normally during this period, though if silenced or interrupted from chanting for a full round, the spell will fade and the held vapors will be freed./This spell does not control a cloud of gas, it only contains it and halts its movement./The material component of the spell is a small balloon or bladder.
Hypnotism|Enchantment/Charm|1|5 yds|1 rd + 1 rd/level|30 ft cube|V, S|1|Neg|The gestures of the wizard, along with his droning incantation, cause 1d6 creatures within the area to become susceptible to a suggestion--a brief and reasonable-sounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard suggestion spell). The request must be given after the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that time, the success of the spell is unknown. Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the caster must speak a language the creature understands for this spell to work). Creatures that successfully roll their saving throws are not under hypnotic influence. Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile save with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is cast at an individual creature that meets the caster's gaze, the saving throw is made with a penalty of -2. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that the caster enspelled it.
Identify|Divination|1|0|1 rd/level|1 item/level|V, S, M|Special|None|When an identify spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw./The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell./The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged./After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character)./The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned.
Illusionary Script|Illusion/Phantasm|3|Touch|1 day/level|Script reader|V, S, M|Special|Special|This spell enables the wizard to write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, etc. The illusionary script appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) who the wizard desires to read the writing can do so. An illusionist recognizes it for illusionary script./Unauthorized creatures glancing at the script must roll saving throws vs. spell. A successful save means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by the caster at the time the illusionary script spell was cast. The suggestion cannot require more than three turns to carry out. The suggestion could be to close the book and leave, or to forget the existence of the book, for example. A successful dispel magic spell will remove the illusionary script, but an unsuccessful attempt erases all of the writing. The hidden writings can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell and either the read magic or comprehend languages spell, as applicable./The material component is a lead-based ink that requires special manufacture by an alchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp per usage.
Illusionary Wall|Illusion/Phantasm|4|30 yds|Permanent|1×10×10 ft|V, S|4|None|This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is permanent until dispelled. It appears absolutely real when viewed (even magically, as with the priest spell true seeing or its equivalent), but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, normal demihuman and magical detection abilities work normally, and touch or probing searches reveal the true nature of the surface, though they do not cause the illusion to disappear./The material component is a rare dust that costs at least 400 gp and requires four days to prepare.
Improved Invisibility|Illusion/Phantasm|4|Touch|4 rds + 1 rd/level|Creature touched|V, S|4|None|This spell is similar to the invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that telltale traces (such as a shimmering effect) sometimes allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's saving throws are made with a +4 bonus. Beings with high Hit Dice that might normally notice invisible opponents will notice a creature under this spell as if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success indicates they spot the character).
Incendiary Cloud|Alteration, Evocation|8|30 yds|4 rds + 1d6 rounds|Special|V, S, M|2|½|An incendiary cloud spell exactly resembles the smoke effects of a pyrotechnics spell, except that its minimum dimensions are a cloud 10 feet tall, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet long. This dense vapor cloud billows forth, and on the third round of its existence begins to flame, causing 1-2 points of damage per level of the spellcaster. On the fourth round it inflicts 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster, and on the fifth round this drops back to 1-2 points of damage per level as its flames burn out. In any successive rounds of existence, the cloud is simply harmless smoke that obscures vision within its confines. Creatures within the cloud need to make only one saving throw if it is successful, but if they fail the first saving throw, they roll again on the fourth and fifth rounds (if necessary) to attempt to reduce the damage sustained by one-half. In order to cast this spell, the wizard must have an available fire source (just as with a pyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath a dung pile, and a pinch of dust.
Invisibility|Illusion/Phantasm|2|Touch|Special|Creature touched|V, S, M|2|None|This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Note, however, that light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source)./The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first. Note that the priest spells bless, chant, and prayer are not attacks for this purpose. All highly Intelligent (Intelligence 13 or more) creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels of experience have a chance to detect invisible objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success means they noticed the invisible object)./The material components of the invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter.
Invisibility, 10' Radius|Illusion/Phantasm|3|Touch|Special|10-ft radius|V, S, M|3|None|This spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. Gear carried and light sources are included, but any light emitted is still visible. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient. Those affected by this spell cannot see each other. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) that attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility, 10' radius spell is broken for all./The material components are the same as for the invisibility spell.
Magic Missile|Evocation|1|60 yds + 10 yds/level|Instantaneous|1-5 targets|V, S|1|None|Use of the magic missile spell creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target. This includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must be able to identify the target. He cannot direct a magic missile to "Strike the commander of the legion," unless he can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect. Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage./For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile--he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple missile capability, he can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired.
Mass Invisibility|Illusion/Phantasm|7|10 yds/level|Special|60×60 yds|V, S, M|7|None|This is a more extensive adaptation of the invisibility spell for battlefield use. It can hide creatures in a 60-yardÃ—60-yard area: up to 400 man-sized creatures, 30 to 40 giants, or six to eight large dragons. The effect is mobile with the unit and is broken when the unit attacks. Individuals leaving the unit become visible. The wizard can end this spell upon command./The material components of the mass invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter.
Mass Suggestion|Enchantment/Charm|6|30 yds|4 turns + 4 turns/level|1 creature/level|V, M|6|Neg|The mass suggestion spell enables the wizard to influence the actions of one or more chosen creatures in the same way as the suggestion spell. Up to one creature per experience level of the caster can be influenced, provided that all subject creatures are within the 30-yard range. Undead are not subject to this spell. The suggestion must be reasonably worded and understood by the creatures, and must be the same for all hearing it. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are unaffected. Saving throws against the spell suffer a penalty of -1, and if a single creature is to be affected, its saving throw suffers a -4 penalty. Note that a very reasonable mass suggestion can cause the saving throw to be made with an additional penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.), at the discretion of your DM. A mass suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, at the DM's discretion. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed./The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
Mind Fog|Enchantment/Charm|5|80 yds|3 turns|20-foot cube|V, S|3|Neg|A mind fog is a physical block of fog that enables the wizard to weaken the mental resistance of his victims. Victims are allowed a saving throw at a -2 penalty to avoid the effects./The penalty to saving throws operates cumulatively with any penalties that operate for other reasons. Affected creatures suffer the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter.
Passwall|Alteration|5|30 yds|1 hr + 1 turn/level|5×8×10 ft|V, S, M|5|None|A passwall spell enables the spellcaster to open a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The spellcaster and any associates can simply walk through. The spell causes a 5-foot wideÃ—8-foot highÃ—10-foot deep opening. Several of these spells can form a continuing passage so that very thick walls can be pierced. If dispelled, the passwall closes away from the dispelling caster, ejecting those in the passage./The material component of this spell is a pinch of sesame seeds.
Permanency|Alteration|8|Special|Permanent|Special|V, S|2 rds|None|
Permanent Illusion|Illusion/Phantasm|6|10 yds/level|Permanent|20-ft cube + 10-ft cube/level|V, S, M|6|Special|When this spell is cast, the wizard creates an illusion with visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements. The spell can create the illusion of any object, creature, or force, as long as it is within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. It affects all creatures that view the illusion, even to the extent of them suffering damage from falling into an illusory pit full of sharp spikes./Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, they see it for what it is and add +4 bonuses to associates' saving throws, if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect are immune until they become aware of it. The permanent illusion is subject to a dispel magic spell, of course./The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.
Phantasmal Killer|Illusion/Phantasm|4|5 yds/level|1 rd/level|1 creature|V, S|4|Special|
Prismatic Sphere|Abjuration, Conjuration/Summoning|9|0|1 turn/level|10-ft radius|V|7|Special|
Prismatic Spray|Conjuration/Summoning|7|0|Instantaneous|70 × 15 ft spray|V, S|7|Special|
Prismatic Wall|Conjuration/Summoning|8|10 yds|1 turn/level|4 ft/level wide × 2 ft/level high|V, S|7|Special|
Programmed Illusion|Illusion/Phantasm|6|10 yds/level|Special|20-ft cube + 10-ft cube/level|V, S, M|6|Special|This spell creates a spectral force spell that activates upon command or when a specific condition occurs. The illusion has visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements. It can be of any object, creature, or force, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect./The occurrence that begins the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, such as the following: "Begin only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged within one foot of this spot." Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level wizard can command the programmed illusion to occur at a maximum encounter range of 60 yards. A programmed illusion cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word. The spell lasts until the illusion occurs; thus, the spell duration is variable. The illusion will last for a maximum of one round per level of the spellcaster./Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, see it for what it is and add +4 bonuses to associates' saving throws, if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect are immune until they become aware of it. The illusion is subject to a dispel magic spell./The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.
Protection from Illusions|Abjuration|3|Touch|2 rds/level|Creature Touched|V, S|3|None|This spell lets the subject see through any illusionary attack, knowing it for what it is.  Protection from illusion provides no protection against phantasms-attacks that exist only in the mind of the subject, such as phantasmal killer.  It does not counter such magics as invisibility, blur, or projected image, nor does it penetrate illusions that conceal.
Protection from Illusions, 10' Radius|Abjuration|5|Touch|2 rds/level|10-ft radius around creature touched|V, S|5|None|The globe of protection of this spell is identical in all respects to a protection from illusions spell, except that it encompasses a much larger area.  The effect is centered on and moves with the creature touched./The protection allows those in the area to see through any illusionary attacks and know them for what they are.  The spell provides no protection against phantasms-attacks that exist only in the minds of those protected,  such as phantasmal killer.  It does not counter such magics as invisibility, blur, or projected image, nor does it penetrate illusions that conceal.
Rainbow Pattern|Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm|4|10 yrds|Special|30-ft cube|S, M|4|Neg|By means of this spell, the wizard creates a glowing, rainbow-hued band of interweaving patterns. Any creature caught in it may become fascinated and gaze at it as long as the effect lasts. The spell can captivate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures--24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affected must be within the area of effect, and each is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. An attack on an affected creature that causes damage frees it from the spell immediately. Creatures that are restrained and removed from the area still try to follow the pattern./Once the rainbow pattern is cast, the wizard need only gesture in the direction he desires, and the pattern of colors moves slowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 feet per round. It persists without further attention from the spellcaster for 1d3 rounds. All affected creatures follow the moving rainbow of light. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second saving throw. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscurement spell, for instance), the spell is negated./The wizard need not utter a sound, but he must gesture appropriately while holding a crystal prism and the material component, a piece of phosphor.
Scare|Enchantment/Charm|2|30 yds + 10 yds/level|1d4 rds + 1 rd/level|15-foot radius|V, S, M|2|Special|This spell causes creatures with fewer than 6 Hit Dice or levels of experience to fall into fits of trembling and shaking. The frightened creatures have a -2 reaction adjustment and may drop items held if encumbered. If cornered, they fight, but with -1 penalties to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws./Only elves, half-elves, and priests are allowed saving throws against this spell. Note that this spell has no effect on the undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and so on), or on upper or lower planar creatures of any sort./The material component used for this spell is a bit of bone from an undead skeleton, zombie, ghoul, ghast, or mummy.
Secure Teleport|Alteration/Universal|5|Touch|Instantaneous|Special|V|2|None|With this spell the wizard instantly transports an item, or items in a container, to a Teleport Beacon.  The Teleport Beacon must be one that the caster knows by exact description.  The placement of the item(s) is specified during casting to within 100 yards of the Beacon.  Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible by means of a secure teleport spell.  The spellcaster is able to teleport a maximum weight of 100 pounds per level./If adequate space is not available for the teleported item(s) to appear in, the spell fails./This spell is known only to the Society of Divided Light.
Solid Fog|Alteration|4|30 yds|2d4 rds + 1 rd/level|20×10×10 ft volume/level of caster|V, S, M|4|None|When this spell is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to a wall of fog spell. The caster can create less vapor if desired, as long as a rectangular or cubic mass at least 10 feet on a side is formed. The fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond 2 feet. However, unlike normal fog, only a very strong wind can move these vapors, and any creature attempting to move through the solid fog progresses at a movement rate of 1 foot per round. A gust of wind spell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire can burn it away in a single round./The material components for the spell are a pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.
Spook|Illusion/Phantasm|1|30 ft|Special|1 creature|V, S|1|Neg|A spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If the creature does not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken. In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.
Stinking Cloud|Evocation|2|30 yds|1 rd/level|20-ft cube|V, S, M|2|Special|When a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 30 yards away from his position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be reeling and unable to attack because of nausea for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the cloud. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. These poisonous effects can be slowed or neutralized by appropriate magic. The cloud duration is halved in a moderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h.) and is dispersed in one round by a stronger breeze./The material component of the spell is a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves.
Suggestion|Enchantment/Charm|3|30 yds|1 hr + 1 hr/level|1 creature|V, M|3|Neg|When this spell is cast by the wizard, he influences the actions of the chosen recipient by the utterance of a few words--phrases or a sentence or two--suggesting a course of action desirable to the spellcaster. The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizard's suggestion--it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands./The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself,  or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizard's party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power./The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed. If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM. Undead are not subject to suggestion./The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
Teleport Beacon|Conjuration/Summoning|4|Touch|Permanent|1 Item|V|2|None|By means of this spell, the caster can make any item touched a beacon for the secure teleport spell.  The item has to be of durable manufacture, and be enchanted by means of an enchant an item spell./This spell is known only to the Society of Divided Light.
Wall of Fog|Evocation|1|30 yds|2d4 rds + 1 rd/level|20 ft cube + 10 ft cube/level|V, S, M|1|None|By casting this spell, the wizard creates a billowing wall of misty vapors in any area within the spell range. The wall of fog obscures all sight, normal and infravision, beyond 2 feet. The caster may create less vapor if he wishes. The wall must be a roughly cubic or rectangular mass, at least 10 feet across in its smallest dimension. The misty vapors persist for three or more rounds. Their duration can be halved by a moderate wind, and they can be blown away by a strong wind./The material component is a pinch of split dried peas.
Weird|Illusion/Phantasm|9|30 yds|Concentration|20-ft radius|V, S|9|Special|This spell confronts those affected by it with phantasmal images of their most feared enemies, forcing an imaginary combat that seems real, but actually occurs in the blink of an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard must be able to converse with the victims to bring the spell into being. During the casting, the wizard must call out to the creatures to be affected, informing one or all that their final fate, indeed their doom, is now upon them./The force of the magic is such that even if the creatures make their saving throws vs. spell, fear will paralyze them for a full round, and they will lose 1d4 Strength points from this fear (the lost Strength will return in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die. If a creature's phantasmal nemesis from the weird spell is slain, the creature emerges with no damage, no loss of items seemingly used in the combat, and no loss of spells likewise seemingly expended. The creature also gains any experience for defeating the weird, if applicable./Although each round of combat seems normal, it takes only one-tenth of a round. During the course of the spell, the caster must concentrate fully upon maintaining it. If the combat goes beyond 10 rounds, those who saved against the spell can take action. If the caster is disturbed, the weird spell ends immediately. Creatures attacked while paralyzed with fear are free of the paralysis immediately.
Target|Alteration|5|10 yrds.|1 turn|Special|V, M|5|Neg.|With this spell the wizard marks a person or creature as the target for any missile weapons and missile like spells. The victim's dexterity will not be a factor to hit after the spell is cast. To cast the spell the wizard throws a dagger used by the wizard in combat at least once before at the intended victim. The dagger does maximum damage and the wizard's THAC0 is equal to that of a fighter of the same level for just the first throw. Any daggers or missiles after that will be at the wizard's original THAC0. All other missile weapons in a 10 yard radius from the victim will hit the victim no matter in which direction it was fired or thrown. The victim can save to negate the spell, though the original dagger throw will still do damage if the victim is hit./The material component is the wizard's dagger used in combat by the wizard at least once before.
Drianna's Hall of Rooms|Alteration, Conjuration (Dimension)|6|10 yrds.|1 hr/level|250 sq. ft./level|S, V, M|6 rds.|none|By means of this spell, the wizard conjures an extradimensional space, entrance to which can be gained at single point of space on the place from which it was cast. From the entry point, those creatures observing the area see only a faint shimmering in the air, in an area of 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. The caster of this spell controls entry to the hall, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind him when he enters. The caster can open it again from his own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they will see a hallway with doors on either side of it. The hallway is 10 feet wide, and has 1+1/level doors. The doors are not locked, but can be from either the inside of the rooms or from the outside, to be determined when the spell is cast. The rooms can be furnished by the caster or not depending on the use of this space. It can be used as a temporary shelter, jail, storehouse, or whatever the caster has in mind. If the rooms are furnished, the furnishings will be only of the basic variety. There is no food in the hallway, but one room can be made into a basic kitchen if the caster wants one. This space can only be entered through its special portal. The outside conditions will not affect the inside of this space./The material components of this spell are a miniature platinum portal, a miniature door made of a rare wood, and a gemstone of no less than 200 gp in value. To alter the rooms, the caster must incorporate those things (sinks, tubs, fireplaces) as miniatures of the originals made of silver./Note: This is a unique spell known only to Drianna StrongOak-Guard.
